The Accuracy Standard — What Makes Info "Inaccurate"
A credit report entry is actionably inaccurate when it is either:
1. Patently incorrect (factually wrong), OR
2. Materially misleading — misleading in such a way and to such an extent that it can be
expected to have an adverse effect on credit decisions.
The information must be objectively and readily verifiable (Sessa v. Trans Union, 74 F.4th 38
(2d Cir. 2023); Mader v. Experian).
Metro 2 Compliance Is Not Itself Law — But It IS Evidence of Accuracy
- Metro 2® is the CDIA-maintained standard format for credit reporting.
- Deviation from Metro 2 alone is not per se an FCRA violation (Davenport v. Capio
Partners).
- BUT — Metro 2 deviations are strong evidence that the information reported is
inaccurate or materially misleading, which IS actionable under FCRA.
- Strategic frame for letters: cite the Metro 2 field violation + explain why that creates a
materially misleading impression + cite the FCRA section being violated.

SECTION 1 — METRO 2 COMPLETE
SPECIFICATION
1.1 What Metro 2® Is
Metro 2® is the industry-standard electronic file format maintained by the Consumer Data
Industry Association (CDIA) for furnishers to report consumer credit data to Equifax, Experian,
Innovis, and TransUnion. The format defines fixed-length fields, valid codes, and the sequence
in which account data is transmitted. The definitive reference is the CDIA Credit Reporting
Resource Guide (CRRG).
Metro 2 is not itself a law. However, the FCRA, FCBA, and ECOA impose the legal duties of
accuracy and completeness that Metro 2 was designed to help furnishers satisfy. When a
furnisher departs from Metro 2 standards, that departure is evidence the reporting is inaccurate
or incomplete.
1.2 Record Structure Overview
A Metro 2 file consists of:
- Header Record — identifies the reporter, software, and reporting period
- Base Segment — one per account; 426 characters (character format) or 366 (packed
format); contains primary account data
- Optional Appended Segments — J1, J2, K1, K2, K3, K4, L1, N1 — add associated
consumers, original creditor, purchased/sold info, mortgage specifics, etc.
- Trailer Record — totals and validation counts
1.3 Base Segment Fields — Complete Reference
The Base Segment contains the primary tradeline data. Key fields critical for dispute analysis:

⚠ Common violations at this field:
- Status 11 (current) combined with Payment History Profile showing late months =
contradictory = materially misleading
- Status 97 (charge-off) with non-zero Current Balance after the account was sold =
inaccurate (balance should be $0 after sale, with K2 Sold To populated)
- Status 13 (paid/zero) with Amount Past Due > 0 = contradictory
- Reporting status 97 after 89 or 94 = prohibited by CRRG
- Third-party collection agency reporting anything other than 62, 93, DA, or DF = violation
1.5 Payment Rating (Field 17B) and Payment History Profile
(Field 18)
Payment Rating (17B): Required when Account Status Code is 05, 13, 61–65, or 88–97.

data/paid), E (zero balance/current), G (collection), H (foreclosure), J (voluntary surrender), K
(repossession), L (charge-off).
⚠ Violations:
- A Payment History Profile showing "L" (charge-off) in months BEFORE the Date of First
Delinquency is internally inconsistent.
- Late-payment codes (1–6) appearing in the PHP while Account Status is 11 (current)
and Amount Past Due is $0 = contradictory.
1.6 Date of First Delinquency (DOFD) — Field 25
This is the single most important field for the 7-year reporting clock under FCRA § 605.
The DOFD is the date of the commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the
reporting of the account as delinquent, charged-off, placed for collection, or similar adverse
action. Once established, the DOFD does NOT change — it anchors the 7-year window (7
years + 180 days per § 605(c) for collections/charge-offs).
⚠ Violations related to DOFD:
- Re-aging — moving the DOFD forward when the account is sold, transferred, or
restructured. This extends the reporting window unlawfully and is a direct FCRA
violation.
- Missing DOFD — for collections and charge-offs, absence of DOFD makes the 7-year
clock unverifiable and the reporting inaccurate.
- DOFD inconsistent with Payment History Profile — if PHP shows no delinquency
preceding the reported DOFD, the DOFD is suspect.
- DOFD past the 7-year + 180-day window — account must be deleted under § 605.
The Rule of Thumb: When an account is sold, the buyer MUST report the same DOFD as the
original creditor (15 USC § 1681s-2(a)(5)).
1.7 Date of Account Information — Field 24
The "as-of" date for the reporting cycle. Best practice and compliance standard: must be within
30 days of the report date. A stale DOAI indicates the furnisher is not monthly-updating as
required.
1.8 Special Comment Codes (Field 19) — EXHIBIT 7 (Selected)
Reported each month as long as the condition applies. Key codes:

---

Code Meaning Required Conditions
B Payments managed by
financial counseling
C Paid by co-maker/guarantor Status 13 or 61–65, balance
= 0
H Loan assumed by another
party
ECOA Code T
M Account closed at credit
grantor's request
Requires Date Closed
O Account transferred to
another company/servicer
AB Debt being paid through
insurance
Status NOT 13 or 61–65
AC Paying under partial payment
agreement
Status NOT 13 or 61–65
AH Purchased by another
company
AS Account closed due to
refinance
AT Account closed due to
transfer (internal)
AU Account paid in full for less
than full balance
Status 13 or 61–65, balance
= 0
AV First payment never received
AW Affected by natural or
declared disaster
BO Foreclosure proceedings

CP Account in forbearance Status NOT 13 or 61–65,
balance NOT 0
DE Debt extinguished under
state law
Status NOT 13 or 61–65,
balance = 0, past due = 0
⚠ Violations:
- Special Comment Code that contradicts Account Status (e.g., Code AU requiring status
13 but account shows status 97)
- Stacking inconsistent comment codes
- Missing required comment when condition applies (e.g., no AH on purchased account)
1.9 Compliance Condition Codes (Field 20) — EXHIBIT 8 —
HIGH-VALUE DISPUTE TARGET
Compliance Condition Codes (CCC) flag legal-compliance conditions: dispute status under
FCRA, FCBA, FDCPA, and consumer-closed accounts.
Code Meaning Key Trigger
XA Account closed at
consumer's request
Date Closed must match
XB Account info disputed by
consumer directly to furnisher
under FCRA; investigation in

XH Account previously in dispute;
furnisher has completed
investigation
USE for FCRA direct,
FDCPA, or FCBA disputes
after completion
XJ Combination: XA + XF
XR Removes the most recently
reported Compliance
Condition Code
Do NOT use as default
⚠ The XB/XH/XC dispute wave — MAJOR litigation pattern:
- Furnisher uses XH after closing an investigation, but consumer never agreed with the
outcome.
- Correct code is XC (FCRA direct, consumer disagrees) — XH does not capture
consumer disagreement.
- This mischaracterization can be materially misleading and has been the subject of recent
federal litigation (Fulton, Wood, Matson cases).
⚠ Other violations:
- XB never being removed after investigation (stale dispute flag)
- No CCC reported despite an active direct dispute to furnisher
- CCC inconsistent with Account Status

---

1.10 ECOA Code (Field 37) — EXHIBIT 10
Defines relationship of consumer to account under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
Code Meaning
1 Individual (primary contractual responsibility)
2 Joint contractual liability
3 Authorized user (no contractual responsibility)
5 Co-maker or guarantor
7 Maker (but co-maker/guarantor liable if
default)
T Terminated association
W Business/commercial
X Deceased (requires legally-sufficient death
notice)
Z Delete consumer from account
⚠ Violations:
- Reporting ECOA 1 (individual) on an account where consumer is only an authorized user
- Reporting ECOA 3 (authorized user) on an account included in the authorized user's
bankruptcy — CRRG requires deletion with Code Z
- ECOA X reported without death certificate
- Obsolete codes 0, 4, 6 still being reported (obsolete since September 2003)
1.11 Consumer Information Indicators (Field 38) — EXHIBIT 11
Flags bankruptcy, reaffirmation, and other consumer conditions on a per-consumer basis.
Code Meaning
A Petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
B Petition for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

---

Code Meaning
C Petition for Chapter 12 Bankruptcy
D Petition for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
E Discharged through Chapter 7
F Discharged through Chapter 11
G Discharged through Chapter 12
H Discharged/completed through Chapter 13
Q Removes previously-reported bankruptcy
indicator; also used for BK closed/terminated
without discharge
R Chapter 7 Reaffirmation of Debt
V Chapter 7 Reaffirmation of Debt Rescinded
1A Personal Receivership
2A Lease Assumption
T Credit grantor cannot locate consumer
U Consumer now located (removes T)
⚠ Violations critical for bankruptcy disputes:
- Account shows balance/past-due after Chapter 7 discharge (Code E) without dismissal
- Account with Code H (Chapter 13 completed) still reporting delinquent status
- Missing CII on an account that was included in bankruptcy
- Reporting a balance due on a discharged (Code E/F/G/H) debt — direct FCRA violation
and potential § 524 bankruptcy discharge injunction violation
1.12 Critical Appended Segments
K1 Segment — Original Creditor Name
REQUIRED for debt buyers, collection agencies, and sold accounts. Names the original
creditor so consumers can identify the debt origin.

---

⚠ Violation: Debt buyer or collection agency reporting WITHOUT K1 = prevents consumer
from knowing what the debt is = materially misleading.
K2 Segment — Purchased From / Sold To
Populated when an account is purchased or sold. Indicates transfer and identifies the other
party.
⚠ Violation: Charge-off sold to a debt buyer, but original creditor still reports a Current Balance
without populating K2 Sold To and zeroing out the balance = double-reporting / inaccurate
balance.
K3 Segment — Mortgage Information
MIN (Mortgage Identification Number) for mortgages.
K4 Segment — Specialized Payment Information
Deferred payment start dates, balloon payment due dates/amounts.
⚠ Violation (Sessa-style): Reporting a balloon payment obligation that the contract does not
require.
1.13 Industry-Specific Rules — Key Points
Collections / Debt Buyers
- May only use Account Status Codes 62, 93, DA, or DF
- MUST report K1 (Original Creditor Name)
- Should NOT report accounts included in discharged/completed bankruptcies acquired
after discharge
- Must NOT report non-contractual debts (fines, tickets, library fines)
- Medical debt: wait ≥ 365 days from DOFD; exclude < $500
Mortgages
- Specific delinquency buckets required
- K3 Segment required
- Foreclosure reporting sequence: 82/84 (delinquent) → BO comment (foreclosure
started) → 65 or 94 (completed) — 97 prohibited after 89/94
Student Loans
- Federal vs. private have separate reporting guidelines

---

- Deferment/forbearance requires specific special comment coding (CP, AL — now
obsolete)
- Post-default federal loans have special rules
Child Support
- Only code CS as Special Comment
- DOFD freezes when youngest child reaches majority
1.14 e-OSCAR Dispute System
e-OSCAR is the CDIA-operated electronic dispute resolution system mandated by FCRA §
611(a)(5)(D). When a consumer disputes an item with a CRA:
1. CRA receives dispute via consumer direct contact
2. CRA transmits Automated Consumer Dispute Verification (ACDV) to furnisher via
e-OSCAR within 5 business days
3. Furnisher has until the end of the 30-day CRA investigation window to respond
4. Furnisher investigates, responds via ACDV (confirm, update, or delete)
5. CRA updates file and notifies consumer within 5 days
⚠ Furnisher violations in this process (from case law):
- Not conducting "reasonable investigation" (per § 1681s-2(b))
- Rubber-stamping ACDV responses without actual review (Seamans, Johnson v. MBNA)
- Not reviewing "all relevant information" provided by CRA
- Not reporting disputed status (Saunders, Gorman)
SECTION 2 — CASE LAW LIBRARY
2.1 The Accuracy Standard Cases
Sessa v. Trans Union, LLC, 74 F.4th 38 (2d Cir. 2023)
Holding: FCRA liability under § 1681e(b) does not require a threshold inquiry into whether an
alleged inaccuracy is "legal" or "factual." Information is actionable if it is objectively and readily
verifiable.
Facts: TransUnion reported that Sessa owed a "balloon payment" at the end of her vehicle
lease — but the lease terms did not require any such payment.

---

Key language: "Allegedly inaccurate information reported on a consumer's credit report must
be objectively and readily verifiable to be actionable under section 1681e(b)... there is no
threshold inquiry under the FCRA as to whether any purportedly inaccurate information is legal
or factual in nature."
How to use it in letters: When a furnisher or CRA argues they can't investigate "legal"
questions (e.g., whether a debt was discharged in bankruptcy, whether a balloon payment
applies, whether a contractual provision was triggered), cite Sessa — the analysis is whether
the facts are objectively and readily verifiable, not whether they involve legal application.
Mader v. Experian Information Solutions, 56 F.4th 264 (2d Cir. 2022)
Holding: Accuracy under the FCRA "requires a focus on objectively and readily verifiable
information." CRAs may be required to accurately report information derived from the readily
verifiable and straightforward application of law to facts.
How to use it: Companion case to Sessa. Cite when furnisher claims the dispute is "too
complex" to investigate.
Seamans v. Temple University, 744 F.3d 853 (3d Cir. 2014)
Holding: Even technically correct information can be "inaccurate" under the FCRA if it creates a
materially misleading impression through omission. Blanket policies limiting investigators to a
short time per dispute and never flagging accounts as disputed can support punitive damages
for willful noncompliance.
How to use it: When a furnisher reports a technically-true data point that omits material context
(e.g., reporting late payments without noting the loan was in forbearance), cite Seamans for the
"materially misleading" theory. Also cite when challenging a furnisher's investigation procedures.
Saunders v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 526 F.3d 142 (4th Cir. 2008)
Holding: Furnisher violated FCRA by failing to report account as disputed after receiving a
meritorious dispute. A furnisher cannot satisfy its duties under § 1681s-2(b) by merely verifying
that the account information is technically correct if the furnisher has received evidence of a
meritorious dispute.
How to use it: Core case for Round 2 letters — cite when furnisher responds to a dispute by
simply "verifying" the information and refusing to note the account is disputed under Compliance
Condition Code XB.

---

Gorman v. Wolpoff & Abramson, LLP, 584 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 2009)
Holding: A furnisher that receives notice of a consumer dispute must report the disputed status
of the debt to CRAs, and that failure to do so can be a violation of § 1681s-2(b). Affirmed the
"materially misleading" standard.
How to use it: Same as Saunders, but for 9th Circuit jurisdictions.
Boggio v. USAA Federal Savings Bank, 696 F.3d 611 (6th Cir. 2012)
Holding: The "materially misleading" standard — information is inaccurate if it is either patently
incorrect OR misleading in such a way that it can be expected to have an adverse effect on
credit decisions.
How to use it: Another jurisdiction-specific citation for the materially-misleading standard.
Frazier v. Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc., 72 F.4th 813 (7th Cir. 2023)
Holding: To bring a § 1681s-2(b) claim, plaintiff must show the furnished information was either
patently incorrect OR materially misleading in a way that can be expected to adversely affect
credit decisions.
How to use it: 7th Circuit version of the materially-misleading standard. Frames what a plaintiff
must plead to survive a motion to dismiss.
2.2 Furnisher Investigation Duty Cases
Johnson v. MBNA America Bank, 357 F.3d 426 (4th Cir. 2004)
Holding: Furnisher's "investigation" under § 1681s-2(b) must be reasonable. Merely confirming
information already in the furnisher's records without investigating the consumer's specific
dispute is insufficient.
How to use it: Cite in Round 2 and direct furnisher disputes — establishes that furnishers
cannot rubber-stamp verifications.
Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management, Inc., 827 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir. 2016)
Holding: When a consumer provides specific information challenging the accuracy of reported
debt, the furnisher's investigation must include review of relevant account documentation — not
just their own records.

---

How to use it: When disputing a collection account and the consumer has submitted specific
facts (e.g., "I never held this account" + proof), cite Hinkle to demand the furnisher actually
review the original documentation, not just their own file.
2.3 Metro 2 and Compliance Condition Code Cases
Davenport v. Capio Partners, LLC (M.D. Pa. 2021)
Holding: Metro 2 non-compliance, standing alone, is not actionable under the FCRA. The
FCRA does not require strict Metro 2 compliance — it requires accuracy.
How to use it (cautiously): Understand that citing Metro 2 alone is not sufficient — letters must
explain WHY the Metro 2 deviation creates inaccurate or materially misleading information
under FCRA § 1681e and § 1681s-2.
The XB/XH/XC Cases (Fulton, Wood, Matson)
Federal district court decisions analyzing furnishers' use of Compliance Condition Codes after
closing investigations. Core holding pattern: whether the code choice (XB, XH, XC) complies
with FCRA depends on matching the underlying facts to the Metro 2 Manual definitions.
How to use it: When a furnisher reports XH (investigation completed) but the consumer never
accepted the outcome and still disagrees, argue the correct code is XC (consumer disagrees)
— using XH is materially misleading because it suggests resolution when none exists.
2.4 The Reasonable Investigation Standard
Bibbs v. Trans Union LLC, 43 F.4th 331 (3d Cir. 2022)
Holding: A furnisher's investigation is reasonable only if it would have uncovered the
inaccuracy. Merely matching data points against the furnisher's own records is often insufficient.
Pittman v. Experian Information Solutions, 901 F.3d 619 (6th Cir. 2018)
Holding: A consumer's notice to the CRA triggers the furnisher's investigation obligation, and
the furnisher must conduct a reasonable investigation appropriate to the specific facts disputed.
2.5 Furnisher Liability and the "Legal Dispute" Issue (Post-2023)
4th Circuit — Roberts/Milgram Line (2024–2025)
Recent Fourth Circuit authority has reinforced that furnishers must investigate disputes based
on objectively and readily verifiable information, regardless of whether the dispute is

---

characterized as "legal" or "factual." The consumer's burden is to show the investigation was
unreasonable, which requires showing both (1) a cognizable inaccuracy and (2) that a
reasonable investigation would have uncovered it.
How to use it: Frames Round 2/3 escalations where the furnisher tries to duck a dispute by
claiming it raises a "legal question."
2.6 CFPB Enforcement Patterns
CFPB consent orders against furnishers and CRAs over the past 5 years show consistent
enforcement themes:
- Failure to investigate consumer disputes reasonably
- Failure to update or delete inaccurate information after confirmed disputes
- Failure to report disputed status (no CCC reported)
- Inadequate policies and procedures under Regulation V
- Reporting discharged bankruptcy debts as active
- Re-aging accounts
Reference the CFPB enforcement actions database at
consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/actions/ for current citations; in letters, a general
reference to "CFPB enforcement patterns concerning [specific violation type]" suffices to signal
regulatory attention.
SECTION 3 — STATUTES (FULL TEXT)
3.1 FCRA — Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681)
§ 1681 — Congressional Findings and Purpose
The stated purpose of the FCRA is to require consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable
procedures for meeting the needs of commerce with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy,
relevancy, and proper utilization of consumer information — fairly and equitably to the
consumer.
§ 1681a — Definitions
Key definitions for disputes:
- "Consumer" — an individual

---

- "Consumer report" — any written, oral, or other communication of information by a
CRA bearing on a consumer's creditworthiness used for credit, insurance, employment,
or similar purposes
- "Consumer reporting agency" (CRA) — any person that regularly engages in
assembling or evaluating consumer information for furnishing consumer reports to third
parties
- "File" — all of the information on a consumer recorded and retained by a CRA,
regardless of how the information is stored
- "Furnisher" — a person who furnishes information to a CRA (defined more fully in
Regulation V)
§ 1681b — Permissible Purposes of Consumer Reports
A CRA may furnish a consumer report only for specified permissible purposes, including:
1. In response to a court order or federal grand jury subpoena
2. With the written instructions of the consumer
3. To a person that intends to use the information in connection with:
- A credit transaction involving the consumer
- Employment purposes (with additional requirements)
- Underwriting insurance involving the consumer
- A legitimate business need in connection with a business transaction initiated by
the consumer
- Review or collection of an account of the consumer
- Assessment of credit or prepayment risks
Dispute strategy: Unauthorized hard inquiries without a permissible purpose violate § 1681b
and can be disputed and removed.
§ 1681c — Time Limits on Reporting Adverse Information
The 7-Year Rule (§ 1681c(a)) — CRAs may NOT report:
- Bankruptcies that antedate the report by more than 10 years
- Civil suits, judgments, paid tax liens, accounts placed for collection, charge-offs, or any
other adverse item of information — older than 7 years
§ 1681c(c) — Running of the 7-year period for collection accounts and charge-offs: The
7-year reporting period for collection accounts and charge-offs runs from the Date of First
Delinquency (the date of the delinquency that immediately preceded the collection activity,
charge-off, or similar action), plus 180 days.

---

Dispute strategy: Any collection, charge-off, or delinquency reporting more than 7 years + 180
days after the DOFD MUST be deleted. Re-aging (moving the DOFD forward) is a direct §
1681c and § 1681s-2(a)(5) violation.
§ 1681c-2 — Block of Information Resulting from Identity Theft
If a consumer submits an identity theft report (typically an FTC Identity Theft Report under 16
CFR Part 603) along with proof of identity to a CRA, the CRA MUST block reporting of the
identified information within 4 business days of receiving the report.
Dispute strategy: For identity theft-related items, this is the most powerful statutory tool — it
mandates deletion without the furnisher investigation process.
§ 1681e — Compliance Procedures (CRA Accuracy Duty)
§ 1681e(b) — The Accuracy Mandate: When preparing a consumer report, a CRA shall
"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy" of the information
concerning the consumer about whom the report relates.
Dispute strategy: § 1681e(b) is the primary statutory hook for claims against CRAs (Equifax,
Experian, TransUnion). When you dispute with the CRA, you're invoking their obligation to follow
reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy.
§ 1681i — Procedure in Case of Disputed Accuracy
§ 1681i(a)(1) — The 30-Day Investigation: If the completeness or accuracy of any item in a
consumer's file is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the CRA directly, the
agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation and record the current
status of the disputed information, or delete the item — before the end of the 30-day period
beginning when the CRA receives the notice.
The 30-day period may be extended by up to 15 additional days if the CRA receives additional
relevant information from the consumer during that window.
§ 1681i(a)(2) — Notice to Furnisher: Within 5 business days of receiving the dispute, the CRA
must notify the furnisher of the dispute and provide all relevant information received from the
consumer.
§ 1681i(a)(3) — Frivolous or Irrelevant: A CRA may terminate a reinvestigation if it reasonably
determines the dispute is frivolous or irrelevant — but must notify the consumer of this
determination within 5 business days.

---

§ 1681i(a)(5)(A) — Deletion of Unverifiable Information: If, after any reinvestigation, an item
of information is found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or cannot be verified, the CRA shall
promptly delete that item or modify it as appropriate.
§ 1681i(a)(5)(B) — Refusal to Reinvestigate Frivolous Disputes: Notification to consumer
required within 5 business days.
§ 1681i(a)(6) — Results of Reinvestigation: CRA must provide written notice of results within
5 business days of completion, including:
- A statement that the reinvestigation is completed
- A consumer report that is based on the consumer's file as revised
- A notice of the right to add a statement to the file
- A notice that describes the method used to verify the information (upon consumer
request)
- § 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii) — Upon consumer request, the CRA must disclose the method
by which it verified the disputed information, including the name, address, and
telephone number of any furnisher of information contacted.
Dispute strategy: This is the "Method of Verification" (MOV) demand used in Round 2 letters.
When the CRA comes back with "verified," you invoke § 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii) and demand to know
HOW they verified.
§ 1681i(a)(7) — Description of Reinvestigation Procedure: Not later than 15 days after
receiving a consumer request for the description of the procedure used to determine accuracy
or completeness, the CRA shall provide a description.
§ 1681n — Civil Liability for Willful Noncompliance
Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement of the FCRA is liable to the
consumer in an amount equal to:
- (A) actual damages sustained by the consumer OR damages of not less than $100 and
not more than $1,000, and
- (B) in the case of liability of a natural person for obtaining a consumer report under false
pretenses, actual damages of not less than $1,000, and
- (2) punitive damages as the court may allow, and
- (3) reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
§ 1681o — Civil Liability for Negligent Noncompliance
Any person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement of the FCRA is liable to
the consumer in an amount equal to:

---

- (1) actual damages sustained, and
- (2) reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
§ 1681s-2 — Responsibilities of Furnishers of Information
§ 1681s-2(a) — Duty to Provide Accurate Information:
- (a)(1)(A): A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any CRA if
the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.
- (a)(1)(B): Reporting information with actual knowledge of errors is prohibited.
- (a)(2): Duty to correct and update information.
- (a)(3): Duty to provide notice of dispute — If the completeness or accuracy of any
information furnished is disputed to such person by a consumer, the person may not
furnish the information to any CRA without notice that such information is disputed by the
consumer.
- (a)(5): Duty to provide notice of delinquency date — When reporting a delinquent
account placed for collection, charged off, or similar action, the furnisher shall, within 90
days of furnishing the information, notify the CRA of the month and year of the
commencement of the delinquency that immediately preceded the action. If the
account was previously reported to a CRA, the furnisher shall report the same date of
delinquency as the original creditor.
§ 1681s-2(b) — Duties Upon Notice of Dispute: After receiving notice pursuant to §
1681i(a)(2) of a dispute with regard to the completeness or accuracy of any information
provided by a person to a CRA, the person shall:
- (A) conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information;
- (B) review all relevant information provided by the CRA pursuant to § 1681i(a)(2);
- (C) report the results of the investigation to the CRA;
- (D) if the investigation finds that the information is incomplete or inaccurate, report those
results to all other nationwide CRAs to which the person furnished the information; and
- (E) if an item of information disputed by a consumer is found to be inaccurate or
incomplete or cannot be verified after any reinvestigation, for purposes of reporting to a
CRA only, as appropriate based on the results of the reinvestigation promptly (i) modify
the item, (ii) delete the item, OR (iii) permanently block the reporting of the item.
Dispute strategy: § 1681s-2(b) is the furnisher's investigation duty. Unlike § 1681s-2(a), which
does not create a private right of action for consumers, § 1681s-2(b) DOES — consumers can
sue furnishers directly for failing to reasonably investigate disputes received via the CRA.
§ 1681s-2(a)(8) — Direct Disputes to Furnishers: The Bureau has prescribed regulations (12
CFR 1022.43) identifying when a furnisher must reinvestigate a dispute based on a direct
request from a consumer. Importantly, the statute recognizes that furnishers are NOT required

---

to investigate disputes submitted by credit repair organizations (as defined in § 1679a(3)). This
is the CRO loophole — furnishers may decline direct disputes they reasonably believe are
templated by a CRO.
§ 1681p — Statute of Limitations
Actions under the FCRA must be brought the earlier of:
- 2 years after the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the violation, OR
- 5 years after the date on which the violation occurs.
3.2 CROA — Credit Repair Organizations Act (15 U.S.C. §§
1679–1679j)
§ 1679a — Definitions
A "credit repair organization" (CRO) is any person who uses interstate commerce to sell
services for the express or implied purpose of:
- Improving any consumer's credit record, credit history, or credit rating, OR
- Providing advice or assistance with regard to such improvement.
Key exclusion: Non-profit organizations, certain creditors, and banks are excluded.
§ 1679b — Prohibited Practices
A CRO may not:
- Make any statement that is untrue or misleading (directly or indirectly) to any CRA or to
any person who has extended credit or is considering extending credit to a consumer,
with respect to a consumer's creditworthiness
- Counsel a consumer to make any such untrue or misleading statement
- Make or use any untrue or misleading representation of the services of the CRO
- Engage in any act, practice, or course of business that constitutes or results in the
commission of a fraud or deception
§ 1679c — Disclosures Required
Before any contract for services, a CRO MUST provide the consumer with a specific "Consumer
Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law" statement — reproduced verbatim from the
statute.

---

§ 1679d — Credit Repair Organizations Contracts
A written, signed contract is REQUIRED. Must include:
- Terms and conditions of payment, including total cost
- Full and detailed description of services to be performed
- Estimated performance date or length of time performance will take
- The CRO's name and principal business address
- Conspicuous notice of 3-day right to cancel
§ 1679e — Right to Cancel Contract
Consumer has 3 business days from contract date to cancel without penalty or obligation.
§ 1679f — Noncompliance with this Subchapter
Contracts in violation of the CROA are void and unenforceable.
§ 1679g — Civil Liability
- Actual damages
- Punitive damages
- Attorney's fees
- Class action available
§ 1679i — Statute of Limitations
5 years from the date of the violation OR the date of discovery of the violation by the consumer.
⚠ COMPLIANCE CRITICAL FOR FUNDHUB CREDIT SOLUTIONS LLC:
- Cannot charge before services are fully performed
- Written contract required, detailing services, costs, timeline
- Mandatory 3-day cancellation right in contract
- Mandatory consumer disclosures before contract
- No false or misleading statements about services or results

---

3.3 FDCPA — Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. §
1692)
§ 1692e — False or Misleading Representations
A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in
connection with the collection of any debt. Includes:
- False representation of character, amount, or legal status of debt
- Threat to take action that cannot legally be taken or is not intended
- Communication of credit information known to be false, including failure to communicate
that a debt is disputed
Dispute strategy: When a collection agency reports a debt without flagging it as disputed (after
receiving a dispute), they violate § 1692e(8). Combined with an FCRA § 1681s-2(a)(3) /
Compliance Condition Code violation.
§ 1692g — Validation of Debts
Within 5 days after the initial communication, a debt collector must send the consumer a written
notice containing:
- Amount of the debt
- Name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed
- Statement that unless the consumer disputes the debt within 30 days, the debt will be
assumed valid
- Statement that if the consumer disputes the debt in writing within 30 days, the debt
collector will obtain verification of the debt and mail it to the consumer
- Statement that upon written request within 30 days, the debt collector will provide name
and address of original creditor
§ 1692g(b) — After Dispute: If the consumer disputes the debt in writing within 30 days, the
debt collector must cease collection until verification is obtained and mailed to the consumer.
Dispute strategy: The § 1692g debt validation letter is the foundational tool for disputing
collection accounts. Combined with FCRA direct dispute, it creates two parallel legal duties the
collector must satisfy — verification (FDCPA) and investigation (FCRA).
§ 1692k — Civil Liability
- Actual damages
- Statutory damages up to $1,000 per action

---

- Attorney's fees and costs
3.4 Regulation V (12 CFR Part 1022, Subpart E) — Furnisher
Rule
12 CFR 1022.42 — Accuracy and Integrity
Furnishers must:
- Establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the
accuracy and integrity of the information they furnish
- Address the policies and procedures appropriate to the nature, size, complexity, and
scope of the furnisher's activities
- Review policies periodically and update as necessary
12 CFR 1022.43 — Direct Disputes
The direct-to-furnisher dispute rule. A consumer may file a direct dispute with a furnisher
regarding:
- The consumer's liability for a credit account
- The terms of a credit account
- The consumer's performance or other conduct concerning an account
- Any other information contained in a consumer report regarding an account that bears
on the consumer's creditworthiness
Furnisher MUST investigate unless:
- The dispute is frivolous or irrelevant (defined narrowly)
- The dispute was submitted by a credit repair organization (the CRO loophole)
Investigation timeline: Furnisher must conduct a reasonable investigation, review all relevant
information, and complete the investigation and notify consumer of results within the same time
period as CRA investigations (generally 30 days, extendable to 45).
Direct dispute requirements (what the consumer must provide):
- Sufficient information to identify the account
- Specific information that the consumer is disputing and explanation of the basis
- All supporting documentation or other information reasonably required to substantiate
the basis of the dispute

---

⚠ The CRO loophole: The single biggest reason quality matters in letter drafting. A templated
letter that looks like it came from a credit repair organization can be lawfully ignored. Letters
must:
- Contain specific, account-level facts
- Not use identical templated language across multiple consumers
- Appear to be written by the consumer personally
- Include consumer-specific supporting documentation
3.5 16 CFR Part 660 — FTC Furnisher Rule
Historical rule (pre-CFPB) — largely superseded by Regulation V, but still relevant for furnisher
accuracy obligations. Essentially parallel to 12 CFR 1022.
SECTION 4 — DISPUTE LETTER STRATEGY
FRAMEWORK
4.1 The 3-Round Attack Strategy
Round 1 — Metro 2 Compliance Dispute (to CRAs)
Recipient: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion (separate letters for each, tailored to which bureau is
reporting what) Statutory Hook: FCRA § 1681e(b) (CRA accuracy duty) + § 1681i (reasonable
reinvestigation) Tone: Firm, professional, fact-specific Deadline: 30 days for CRA to investigate
Structure:
1. Consumer identification header (full legal name, current address, DOB, SSN last 4)
2. Clear statement of dispute purpose
3. For each disputed item: identify the tradeline, specify the Metro 2 field violations, explain
why the reporting is inaccurate or materially misleading
4. Cite FCRA § 1681e(b), § 1681i(a)(1), § 1681i(a)(5)
5. Request: investigation within 30 days, deletion if unverifiable, method of verification
disclosure
6. Include personal info corrections (old addresses, name variants) — Compliance
Condition Code XA or Special Comment relevant
7. Include inquiry removals for unauthorized hard inquiries — cite § 1681b (permissible
purpose)

---

8. Signature + date
9. Enclosures: copy of ID, proof of address, any supporting documents
Key Metro 2 violations to flag per tradeline type (see § 4.3 below)
Round 2 — FCRA Escalation / Method of Verification Demand
Recipient: CRAs (same bureaus) AND/OR directly to furnisher Statutory Hook: FCRA §
1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii) (MOV disclosure) + § 1681i(a)(7) (description of reinvestigation procedure) + §
1681s-2(b) (furnisher duty) + FDCPA § 1692g (for collections) Tone: Aggressive but
professional; legal citation-heavy Sent when: Round 1 results come back "verified" without
deletion
Structure:
1. Reference Round 1 dispute date and outcome
2. For each item that was "verified":
- Demand method of verification disclosure (§ 1681i(a)(6)(B)(iii))
- Demand description of reinvestigation procedure (§ 1681i(a)(7))
- Cite Saunders v. Branch Banking (4th Cir.) — cannot just verify
technically-correct info
- Cite Gorman v. Wolpoff (9th Cir.) — must flag disputed status
- Cite Sessa v. Trans Union (2d Cir.) — objectively verifiable standard applies
3. For collections: parallel FDCPA § 1692g debt validation demand
4. Warning: intent to file CFPB complaint, state AG complaint, potential FCRA litigation
5. Demand response within 15 days
6. Signature + date
Round 3 — Final Notice / Willful Noncompliance
Recipient: CRAs AND furnisher AND cc: CFPB, state AG Statutory Hook: FCRA §
1681i(a)(5)(A) (failure to verify = delete) + § 1681n (willful noncompliance, $100–$1,000 per
violation + punitive) + § 1681o (negligent noncompliance) Tone: Final notice, litigation-ready
Sent when: Round 2 fails to produce deletion or proper method of verification
Structure:
1. Reference Round 1 and Round 2 dates
2. State: "This is your final notice under the FCRA."
3. Cite § 1681i(a)(5)(A) — failure to verify within 30 days REQUIRES deletion
4. Cite § 1681n — willful noncompliance ($100–$1,000 per violation + punitive + fees)
5. Cite § 1681o — negligent noncompliance (actual + fees)
6. For collections: cite FDCPA § 1692k (statutory up to $1,000 + fees)
7. Specific demand: permanent deletion within 15 days

---

8. Notice of intent to file CFPB complaint with copy enclosed
9. Notice of intent to file state AG complaint with copy enclosed
10. Notice of intent to pursue private action for statutory damages
11. CC line showing CFPB and state AG mailing addresses
12. Signature + date
4.2 Direct-to-Furnisher Disputes (12 CFR 1022.43)
When to use: Best when the consumer has specific documentary evidence (original contract,
payment records, paid-in-full letter) that contradicts what's being reported.
Structure:
1. Consumer identification
2. Specific account identification
3. Exact information being disputed
4. Basis for dispute (factual, specific)
5. Supporting documentation attached
6. Cite 15 USC § 1681s-2(b) — furnisher investigation duty
7. Cite 12 CFR 1022.43 — direct dispute rule
8. Demand deletion or correction within 30 days
9. Demand Compliance Condition Code XB be reported during investigation
10. Demand proper updated Compliance Condition Code after investigation (XC if consumer
will disagree, not XH)
⚠ CRO loophole mitigation: The letter must look personal, not templated. Use specific facts,
consumer voice, handwritten signature, personal address. Avoid generic legal boilerplate
language that signals credit repair origin.
4.3 Violation Patterns by Tradeline Type
Collections (Third-Party Debt Buyer or Collection Agency)
Most common violations:
- Missing K1 Segment (Original Creditor Name) — cannot identify source of debt
- Missing DOFD (Field 25) — 7-year clock unverifiable

- Re-aged DOFD (date of first delinquency shows after sale date, which is impossible)
- Reporting without first sending § 1692g validation notice
- Both original creditor AND collector reporting a balance (double-reporting)
- Medical debt under $500 or within 365 days of DOFD (post-2023 rule)

---

- Late payment reported during active forbearance (should have Special Comment Code
CP)
- Late payment reported during natural disaster period (should have Special Comment
Code AW)
- Late payment reported during active dispute (should have Compliance Condition Code
XB)
Letter citations: FCRA § 1681e(b), § 1681s-2(a)(1)(A) (no knowingly inaccurate), Seamans
(materially misleading)
Medical Debt (Post-2023 Rules)
Most common violations:
- Medical collection under $500 — must be deleted (2023 rule change)
- Medical debt reported within 365 days of DOFD (1-year wait rule)
- Paid medical collections still reporting as open
- Old medical collections past 7-year window
Letter citations: FCRA § 1681c, CDIA/CRA medical debt policy (1-year wait, $500 minimum)

---

Repossessions (Account Status 63, 95, 96)
Most common violations:
- Balance > 0 after voluntary surrender/repossession and sale proceeds applied
- Missing Special Comment Codes (AO, AZ, BI, BJ, BK as appropriate)

Balance > 0
- Missing CII on an account included in bankruptcy
- Status code showing delinquency on discharged account (should typically be status 13
with CII E/H)
- Authorized user (ECOA Code 3) not removed with Code Z on account included in
bankruptcy
- Account continuing to show past-due activity after petition date
Letter citations: FCRA § 1681e(b), Bankruptcy Code § 524 (discharge injunction), Metro 2
Exhibit 11 (CII requirements)
Student Loans
Most common violations:
- Federal loans not properly showing deferment/forbearance (Special Comment Codes)
- Old defaulted loans past 7-year window from DOFD
- Rehabilitated loans not properly updated
- Private loans discharged in bankruptcy (undue hardship) still reporting as active
Hard Inquiries
Most common violations:

---

- Inquiry without permissible purpose under § 1681b
- Duplicate inquiries same day (multiple hits from one application)
- Inquiry after account was not opened (permissible purpose question)
- Promotional inquiries incorrectly classified as hard inquiries
Letter citations: FCRA § 1681b (permissible purposes), § 1681m (adverse action notice)
Personal Information Errors
Most common violations:
- Old addresses (more than 2 cycles old)
- Incorrect or misspelled name variants
- Wrong DOB or SSN fragments
- Employment info that's out of date
- Mixed files (information belonging to another consumer)
Letter citations: FCRA § 1681e(b), § 1681i(a)
4.4 Identity Theft Block (§ 1681c-2)
When to use: Any account opened fraudulently, unauthorized inquiries from identity theft,
unauthorized address or personal info.
Process:
1. File FTC Identity Theft Report at identitytheft.gov
2. File police report
3. Submit to CRAs:
- The FTC Identity Theft Report
- Proof of identity
- Identification of the information to be blocked
- Statement that the information does not relate to any transaction by the
consumer
4. CRA MUST block within 4 business days
This is the single most powerful dispute tool. It bypasses the furnisher investigation process
entirely.
4.5 CFPB and State AG Complaint Escalation
CFPB Complaint (consumerfinance.gov/complaint):

---

- Files within hours
- Company typically responds within 15 days
- Often triggers deletion where prior disputes failed
- Creates public record visible to consumer
- Used in Round 3 as threatened or actual escalation
State AG Complaint:
- Varies by state
- Arizona Attorney General: azag.gov/consumer
- Many states have specific credit reporting consumer divisions
- Slower than CFPB but adds pressure
4.6 Letter Quality Rules (To Avoid CRO Dismissal)
Per 12 CFR 1022.43, furnishers can disregard direct disputes they reasonably believe came
from a credit repair organization. To avoid dismissal:
1. Use consumer-specific facts. Every letter must reference specific account details —
exact balance, exact dates, specific Metro 2 field and value.
2. Avoid templated legal language. Replace generic phrases with specific references to
the consumer's file.
3. Include consumer-provided documentation. Original contracts, payment records,
paid-in-full letters, FTC ID theft reports.
4. Handwritten signature when possible (scanned signature image OK if not
pixel-identical across letters).
5. Consumer's actual return address (not a credit repair company PO box).
6. Avoid boilerplate opening/closing paragraphs. Vary the opening across consumer
letters.
7. First-person voice. Write AS the consumer, not as a third party "representing" them.
8. Unique formatting per consumer. Don't use identical letter templates with just name
swaps.
9. Consumer-specific basis for each dispute. "I never lived at this address" with proof
beats "This address is inaccurate."

5.8 Output Priority Ranking for AI Letter Generation
When multiple violations are found on a single tradeline, the AI should prioritize in this order for
dispute letter emphasis:
1. Most powerful (likely deletion): 7-year window expired, identity theft, unverifiable
DOFD, discharged bankruptcy balance
2. Strong (high leverage): Re-aging, missing K1 on collection, double-reporting,
status/balance contradictions
3. Moderate: Compliance Condition Code errors, Payment History contradictions, missing
Special Comments
4. Supporting: Personal info errors, inquiry challenges
AI PROMPT INTEGRATION GUIDE
How to Use This Knowledge Base in the Underwrite IQ System
Step 1: Load as Context Module
This document should be loaded as part of the Claude API system prompt for dispute letter
generation. Recommended structure:

---

const METRO2_KB = fs.readFileSync('./METRO2_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md', 'utf8');
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
You are Underwrite IQ's dispute letter generator for FundHub Credit Solutions LLC.
You have comprehensive knowledge of Metro 2 format, FCRA, FDCPA, Regulation V,
and federal case law contained in the knowledge base below.
${METRO2_KB}
Your job is to analyze the client's credit report data and generate dispute letters
that identify specific Metro 2 field violations and cite the correct statutes and
case law. Letters must be consumer-specific, not templated, to avoid the CRO loophole
under 12 CFR 1022.43.
`;
Step 2: Structure the Tradeline Input
Feed the AI each tradeline with Metro 2 field mappings already parsed:
{
"creditor": "Midland Funding",
"account_number_last4": "4521",
"portfolio_type": "O",
"account_type": "48",
"date_opened": "2019-03-15",
"field_17A_account_status": "93",
"field_17B_payment_rating": "G",
"field_18_payment_history": "GGGGGGGGGGGG...",

---

"field_19_special_comment": null,
"field_20_compliance_condition": null,
"field_21_current_balance": 2100,
"field_22_amount_past_due": 2100,
"field_24_date_of_account_info": "2025-12-15",
"field_25_dofd": null,
"field_37_ecoa": "1",
"field_38_cii": null,
"k1_original_creditor": null,
"k2_purchased_from": null,
"bureau_reporting": ["EQ", "EX", "TU"]
}
Step 3: Run the Violation Checklist
The AI uses Section 5's checklist to identify all applicable violations per tradeline.
Step 4: Generate Letters with Citations
For each violation found, the AI cites:
- Metro 2 field and expected value (from Section 1)
- FCRA/FDCPA/Regulation V statute (from Section 3)
- Relevant case law holding (from Section 2)
- Strategy-appropriate language (from Section 4)
Step 5: Round-Specific Prompting
Use different sub-prompts for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3 — each builds on the prior round.
Round 1 is Metro 2/accuracy-focused. Round 2 adds MOV demand and case law. Round 3
adds damages demand and complaint escalation.

---

Step 6: CRO-Loophole Mitigation
Every generated letter must:
- Use consumer-specific facts (balances, dates, account numbers from the actual file)
- Avoid identical language across consumers
- Use first-person consumer voice
- Reference consumer-specific documentation
Recommended AI Temperature/Settings
- Temperature: 0.3–0.5 (lower = more consistent citations; higher = more consumer-voice
variation)
- Max tokens: 2000–3000 per letter
- Use Claude Opus for Round 2/3 (complex legal citations) and Claude Sonnet for Round
1 (straightforward Metro 2)
Quality Validation Checklist (Post-Generation)
Before sending letters, validate:
All cited Metro 2 fields are correctly referenced per Section 1
All statutory citations match Section 3 exactly
Case law citations match Section 2 (case name, citation, circuit)
Letter contains specific account-level facts
No identical phrasing used across multiple client letters
Consumer return address is the actual consumer's
Enclosures referenced are actually attached
Updating This Knowledge Base
This knowledge base should be updated when:
- CDIA releases a new CRRG edition (approximately every 2 years)
- Supreme Court or circuit courts issue new major FCRA rulings
- CFPB issues new furnisher rules or significant consent orders
- New Metro 2 codes are added or codes become obsolete (check www.cdiaonline.org
annually)
For live case law monitoring: set up CourtListener alerts (courtlistener.com) for "FCRA furnisher"
and "Metro 2" queries.
