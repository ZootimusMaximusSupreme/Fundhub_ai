# Manual SOPs — until SMS / email / AI calling are automated

**Owner:** Chris  
**Stack (owner-set 2026-08-14):** SMS = Twilio (prove Monday) · Email = Resend · Voice = Bland · CRS = sandbox today  
**Rule:** No secrets in these files. If a link is not known from the repo, it says **UNKNOWN**.

Use these when the app is not yet sending texts, emails, or calls by itself. When a channel goes live in code, still run the [daily handoff checklist](./daily-handoff-checklist.md) until that channel is proven.

## Index

| SOP | File | When to use |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Manual SMS (Twilio) | [manual-sms-twilio.md](./manual-sms-twilio.md) | Send or answer a text by hand |
| Manual email (Resend) | [manual-email-resend.md](./manual-email-resend.md) | Send or answer an email by hand |
| Manual call / booking follow-up (Bland) | [manual-call-bland.md](./manual-call-bland.md) | Place or check an AI call; book / follow up |
| Manual dispute letters | [manual-dispute-letters.md](./manual-dispute-letters.md) | DIRTY / REPAIR_ONLY / downsell only — never funding |
| Daily handoff checklist | [daily-handoff-checklist.md](./daily-handoff-checklist.md) | Start and end of day: what is manual vs automated |

## Hard rules (all SOPs)

1. Do not dump the paused outbound queue.
2. Do not put API keys, passwords, or tokens in notes, tickets, or these docs.
3. Log every manual send in the CRM client record (date, channel, who, what, outcome).
4. Dispute letters: **downsell / DIRTY / REPAIR_ONLY only**. Never for a funding-path client.
