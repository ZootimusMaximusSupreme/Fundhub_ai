# role-funding-advisor — intended

> ⚠️ **WRITTEN AFTER THE FACT, NOT BEFORE IT.** CLAUDE.md §4 calls this file the
> hand-authored source of truth, checked against the code — and says agents do
> not write it, because an agent writing it would be authoring the very thing
> its own work is supposed to be checked against. This one is an explicit,
> one-time exception: the owner directed it be created from current behavior
> because none existed at all (`docs/journeys/README.md` recorded that gap
> from 2026-07-31 to 2026-08-02). It was generated on 2026-08-02 from the same
> extracted route data as [`role-funding-advisor-actual.md`](./role-funding-advisor-actual.md) —
> not from a product spec, a ticket, or anyone's independent judgment of what
> *should* happen. A match against `-actual.md` right now proves only that
> this file was copied from it, not that either one is correct. Replace this
> page's judgment calls with a human's the next time this journey changes on
> purpose — that is the point of having two files at all.

## Comparing this against reality

Run `npm run journeys` and read [`role-funding-advisor-actual.md`](./role-funding-advisor-actual.md). There is no automated
diff between the two files — CLAUDE.md §4 describes intended vs. actual as a human
comparison, and this repository has never built a machine check for it. Read both,
side by side, and treat any difference between them as a finding to report, not
something to silently fix in either file.
