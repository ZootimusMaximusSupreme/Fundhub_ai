-- 008_contract_messages.sql — the two emails the contract feature sends.
--
-- WHY THESE ARE TEMPLATES AND NOT STRINGS IN CODE. Same reason every other piece
-- of copy in this platform is a row: changing the wording must never need a
-- developer. These two are editable from public/app/template-editor.html like
-- the other 176, and the send path reads them at send time.
--
-- compliance_passed IS TRUE, and that is the same treatment every seeded
-- template gets — the flag records that the copy shipped reviewed, with
-- approved_by NULL because no person clicked approve (116_template_approval.sql
-- explains why NULL is the honest value there rather than a backfilled name).
-- Editing either one through the editor clears the flag, and the send then
-- reports `template_not_approved` and skips the email until somebody re-approves
-- it. The contract still sends; only the email waits.
--
-- WHAT THEY DELIBERATELY DO NOT SAY. No promise about funding, no claim about a
-- credit outcome, no deadline that is not real. A contract notification is a
-- delivery notice, not a marketing message.
--
-- MERGE TAGS. `contact.first_name` and `contract.*` are supplied by
-- signerContext() in src/contracts/notify.mjs — NOT by clientContext(), because
-- a signer may be a counterparty who is not a client at all.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT (Rule 9): ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, so a re-run cannot duplicate or
-- overwrite wording somebody has since edited.
