-- 262_staff_avatar_key.sql — storage key for an employee's own profile photo.
--
-- Nullable: most staff rows will never set one. Opaque string, not a URL —
-- same contract as document_versions.storage_key in src/documents/store.mjs
-- (a bearer credential under some providers), so it is never selected by any
-- read that returns rows to a caller. GET /api/staff/avatar resolves it
-- server-side and streams bytes back; it is never handed out directly.

ALTER TABLE staff ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS avatar_key text;
