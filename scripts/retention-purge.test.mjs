// Unit tests for the retention purge runner. No database — these run everywhere,
// including with DATABASE_URL unset, and they are the tests that pin the safety
// properties.
//
// THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST is "a dry run issues no write statement". It does not
// check a flag and it does not trust the runner's own report. It watches every
// piece of SQL the tool sends and fails if any of it is an UPDATE, DELETE,
// INSERT, TRUNCATE, DROP or ALTER. A dry run that quietly wrote would fail here
// even if every counter it printed said zero.
//
// This file lives under scripts/ because package.json's test glob is
// "src/**/*.test.mjs" and "scripts/**/*.test.mjs". A test outside those two trees
// is never collected and passes forever by never running (CLAUDE.md §12).
