// For the manual walkthrough (docs/workflows/manual-walkthrough-SOP.md). Chris
// opts a simulated client in through ClickFunnels; this puts the credit report
// behind that client WITHOUT touching the bureau — no CRS call, no $32, no
// inquiry on anyone's file. Everything downstream of a real pull still runs:
// the crs_results row, tradelines, card liabilities, the REAL tier engine, and
// the two events (analysis.completed, decision.rendered) that move the card and
// stamp the tier, exactly as src/finance/crs-pull.mjs does after a vendor call.
//
// The payload is stamped `environment: "simulated"` + `simulated: true`, the
// same marks src/demo/simulate-client.mjs and crs-pull's rehearsal mode use, so
// every screen and event can tell it was never a bureau pull. Each bureau report
// says it again in its own `responseDetail.requestingParty`, so a per-bureau view
// that never sees the top level still cannot mistake this for a bureau pull. The
// client row is NOT flagged is_demo — these clients must show on every dashboard
// like a real one, because that is what is being tested.
//
// Profiles are shaped for the path being walked (see PROFILES). The tier engine
// decides the outcome; nothing here forces a tier.
//
// ── WHAT THE 2026-09-05 REBUILD CHANGED, AND WHY ──────────────────────────
//
// The old profiles were invented. They wrote the tradeline and score sections
// and left everything else empty, so whole halves of the system had never once
// run against them. The sections below are now shaped off the REAL vendor
// payloads — vendor/underwriteiq-crs/sandbox/{efx,exp}.json and
// vendor/underwriteiq-full/api/lite/crs/sandbox/tu.json — field for field:
//
//   * PERSONAL INFORMATION. `creditFiles[].aliases / addresses / employments /
//     dobs / ssns` were all empty arrays. That is the single source of name and
//     address variants anywhere in this system, so the owner's rule (2026-09-03:
//     credit repair ALWAYS consolidates to one legal name and one current
//     address and disputes every inquiry with no matching open account) could
//     never fire, on any profile, ever. It is now populated on all three files —
//     including the clean one, because the rule says even a clean file gets the
//     cleanup.
//   * responseDetail. Missing entirely, so `bureaus[].reportDate` was never set
//     and every month-age calculation in the engine — anchor seasoning, the 6-
//     and 12-month inquiry windows, report freshness — silently measured against
//     the wall clock instead of against the file.
//   * adverseRatings. The collections counter reads
//     `adverseRatings.highest.type === "CollectionOrChargeOff"`, NOT
//     currentRatingType (derive-consumer-signals.js). The old sim wrote the
//     rating type and no adverseRatings at all, so `derogatories.collections`
//     was 0 on every profile and the ACTIVE_COLLECTION reason code had never
//     been emitted once. The collection lines below carry a real month-by-month
//     adverse history, which is also the only date-of-first-delinquency the
//     system ever gets (normalize-soft-pull.js inferDofd).
//   * SCORES. One bare FICO row per bureau with no factors. Real responses ship
//     non-credit models in the same array (Experian's Income Insight, TU's
//     CreditVision Income Estimator) and TU returns its FICO row twice, which is
//     the whole reason pickCreditScore and the FICO whitelist exist. Both now
//     get exercised.
//   * INQUIRIES. Hardcoded subscriberCode "SIM", never duplicated, always from a
//     creditor already on the file. Each profile now carries a same-day duplicate
//     pair on Equifax (the real EQ quirk, and the one inquiry rule that can fire
//     from payload data alone — M2-036) and at least one inquiry from a creditor
//     with no account anywhere on the file.
//
// Everything the profiles assert about the owner's own identity — his legal
// name, his date of birth, his current address, the addresses he actually lived
// at before — is READ AT RUN TIME from credentials/sim-identity/owner-identity.local.json.
// None of it is written into this file. See loadOwnerIdentity below.

   SECOND REBUILD HAZARD. checkAddressConflicts compares the FIRST address of

   That is not fatal — it passes with reduced confidence — but it is noise on a
   file that has none, so the current address leads every bureau's list and the
   former addresses follow it. `borrowerResidencyType: "Current"` is the vendor's
   own current/former marker and it appears ONLY on the current one, exactly as
   in exp.json: an address without it is a former address, and that absence is
   what M2-031 keys on.

   throws away any personal-information claim whose subject starts with the
   client's own current street. Both sides come from this one identity file, so

       the first of last month made all of them stale, which put a stale-data
       claim on every line of the CLEAN file — a letter arguing that four
       perfectly-reported accounts are out of date. Six days back is what an
       account that is actually being furnished looks like.

       A CLOSED ACCOUNT IS REPORTED TOO, AND THAT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS.
       This used to be `closed || daysBefore(asOf, 6)` — a closed account carried
       its own close date as its reported date — on the reasoning that a furnisher
       stops updating a dead account. That reasoning is wrong twice over.

       Wrong on the facts: a charged-off balance is still furnished every month
       until it is sold or paid, and the real vendor payload agrees. In
       vendor/underwriteiq-crs/sandbox/efx.json the charged-off row is reported
       2025-08-01 with last activity 2024-04-01, and the closed HOLIDAY FINANCE
       row is reported 2025-07-01 against a close date of 2025-03-01. Reported
       date AFTER close date, on both.

       Wrong on the consequences, which is the expensive half: an old reported
       date fires M2-005 on that account, and mergeDerogatoryClaims
       (src/metro2/diy/derogatory.mjs) DROPS any DEROG-* claim whose creditor and
       last four are already covered by a Metro 2 violation. So the stale-date
       finding silently ate the charge-off dispute. The client's letter argued
       "this account has not been updated" instead of "I dispute this charged-off
       account", on every bureau of both repair files — and on repair-trial's
       Equifax copy the charge-off is the ONLY negative, so that bureau produced
       no derogatory claim at all.

       So the reported date is fresh unless a line ASKS to be stale, via
       `reportedMonthsAgo`. Only accounts with nothing else to dispute ask for it
       (see CREDIT ONE BANK and WELLS FARGO CARD below), which is how the walk
       keeps an M2-005 finding to look at without that finding swallowing a
       dispute that matters more.

       `lastActivityDate` is a different field and it keeps the close date. Date
       of last activity on a dead account really is old, no Metro 2 rule reads it
       (only accountReportedDate maps to field 24 — src/metro2/normalize.mjs:197),

        matches the inquiry name against the reported creditor names verbatim,
        so this is the control case that proves a match is possible.
     2. An inquiry from a creditor with NO account anywhere on the file. That is
        the owner's rule — dispute every inquiry with no matching open account —
        and it is what M2-035 looks for.
     3. A same-day duplicate pair on EQUIFAX, same creditor, same subscriber
        code. Equifax really does return the same inquiry twice; the engine
        de-duplicates Equifax inquiries and nothing else, so this exercises that
        path AND gives M2-036 (one application, more than one entry) the only

    /* F43 — THE TRIPLE COUNT, AND WHY IT CANNOT COME BACK HERE.
       Every account was being counted three times in the deliverables: nine card
       rows for three cards, and dollar totals three times what they should have
       been. The mechanism is that a tri-merge pull genuinely carries the same
       account from three bureaus, and a printer that lists them without merging
       prints it three times.

       This list is ONE ROW PER ACCOUNT. It is what the tradeline ingest, the
       card liabilities ingest and the inquiry events read, so nothing that reads
       it can triple anything. The per-bureau reports above keep all three copies,
       because that is what a real file looks like and pretending otherwise would
       make the simulation useless — but every copy carries the SAME
       accountIdentifier, so anything that wants to merge them has the key to do
       it with.

       THE PRINTER HALF IS NOW FIXED TOO (2026-09-05). Storing one row per account
       here was never enough on its own: the Black Report does not read this list.
       It re-runs the engine over the stored file and prefers the engine's
       re-normalized list, which is all three bureau copies concatenated — so the
       funding walk still printed nine card rows, a $135,000 credit line against a
       real $45,000, and a paydown target of $13,500 against a real $4,500. That is
       fixed where it belongs, in src/underwrite/black-report-client.mjs, which now
       collapses bureau copies on accountIdentifier before it prints or sums. Do
       not "fix" it a second time by hiding the duplicates in this file — a real
       tri-merge pull carries them and the simulation has to as well. */
