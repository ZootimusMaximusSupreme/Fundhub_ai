// Real-Postgres tests for migration 100 and the retention purge runner.
//
// SKIPS unless DATABASE_URL is set, like every other .pg.test.mjs here. Skipped,
// not passed — a suite that reports green without a database has told you
// nothing, and CLAUDE.md §12 records that ~193 tests in this repo already skip
// silently for exactly this reason.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES THAT THE UNIT TESTS CANNOT.
//
// scripts/retention-purge.test.mjs watches the SQL the tool sends and proves a
// dry run issues no write statement. That is a claim about the code. This file
// makes the claim about the DATABASE: it counts every row in all five tables,
// runs a dry run, counts again, and fails if a single number moved. If some
// future refactor routes a write through a path the fake handle never sees, the
// unit test could still pass and this one would not.
//
// It also pins the things only a real server can answer:
//   * the CHECK constraint's class list and DATA_CLASSES agree
//   * every seeded retain_days really is NULL, so a fresh database purges nothing
//   * de-identification leaves amount_cents exactly as it was
//   * a purge scoped to one org does not touch another org's rows
//
// This file lives under scripts/ because package.json's test glob is
// "src/**/*.test.mjs" and "scripts/**/*.test.mjs".
