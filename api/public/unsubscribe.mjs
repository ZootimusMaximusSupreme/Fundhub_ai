// GET/POST /api/public/unsubscribe — the door behind the unsubscribe link.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED. This is consent capture: a POST here withdraws a
// person's permission to be emailed, and the send gate reads that row on every
// later send.
//
// NO AUTH, BY DESIGN. Same class as the soft-pull approval link and the
// contract link: the person clicking is not signed in and must never be made
// to sign in to get out of a mailing list. The signed token IS the credential
// and it is verified before anything is read or written.
//
// GET DOES NOT UNSUBSCRIBE. THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON THE ENDPOINT HAS TWO
// VERBS. Mail security scanners fetch every URL in a message before the person
// ever sees it — the same behaviour documented in src/auth/magic-link.mjs,
// where it was burning single-use sign-in links before the client opened them.
// A GET that wrote the row would unsubscribe people who never clicked, and we
// would have no way of telling that from a real one. So GET reports the state
// and POST is the act.
