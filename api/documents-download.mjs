// GET /api/documents-download?id=<uuid> — mint a FRESH signed link for a saved
// document, for a caller who is signed in right now.
//
// THE HOLE THIS FILLS. A working link to a saved file was minted exactly once,
// in the reply to the upload (api/documents-upload.mjs), and expired 15 minutes
// later. After that the bytes were unreachable: api/read/documents and
// api/read/portal-summary both serve metadata with storage_key stripped, and
// api/documents/[id].mjs takes a signature it has no way to obtain. So an ID a
// client photographed and a letter the system generated both saved correctly
// and could never be opened again. This endpoint is the missing half — the four
// readers in src/documents/retrieve.mjs were written for it and had zero
// callers.
//
// IT MINTS, IT DOES NOT SERVE. The bytes still come from api/documents/[id].mjs,
// which is unchanged. This endpoint answers "what is a link I can use", the
// other one answers "give me the file". Two gates, deliberately different:
//
//   here                        api/documents/[id].mjs
//   ────                        ──────────────────────
//   a live session              the HMAC on the link
//   org + ownership in SQL      the signature and its expiry
//
// That split is why an emailed link keeps working for a signed-out client while
// this endpoint refuses everyone who is not signed in.
//
// NOTHING NEW IS SIGNED HERE. signDocumentUrl() lives in
// src/documents/signed-url.mjs and is reached through shapeDocument() inside
// retrieve.mjs — see getDocument()'s `sign` option. There is one signing
// implementation in this repo and this file is not a second one.
//
// LIVES AT api/documents-download.mjs, NOT api/documents/download.mjs, for the
// reason api/documents-upload.mjs spells out: netlify/functions/api.mjs reaches
// the signed download route by a PREFIX branch on "documents/", and
// src/http/routes.test.mjs deliberately fails on any exact ROUTES key that would
// sit under that prefix and depend on lookup order.
//
// STORAGE KEYS NEVER APPEAR. getDocument() selects an explicit column list that
// omits storage_key and shapeDocument() deletes it again for good measure. This
// file adds no query of its own, so there is no third place for one to escape.
//
// NOTHING IS LOGGED. No filename, no title, no storage key, no URL. A log line
// naming a document is a leak on a screen full of credit reports and photo IDs,
// and a log line containing a signed URL is a bearer credential in a log file.
