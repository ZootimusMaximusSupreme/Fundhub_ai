/* POST /api/journeys/run — walk every branch of every journey and report what
 * the code actually did.
 *
 * Owner/admin only, same gate as /api/journeys and /api/journeys/ask and for
 * the same reason: a run drives the real event bus into the real workflows.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE WHOLE RUN HAPPENS INSIDE ONE TRANSACTION THAT IS ALWAYS ROLLED BACK
 *
 * This is the answer to "a synthetic client must never show up on the closer
 * dashboard next to a real one", and it is a stronger answer than filtering
 * every read path would be:
 *
 *   * nothing the run writes is ever visible to anything else — not the
 *     clients it mints, not the messages, not the tasks, not the events
 *   * it needs no deletes, which CLAUDE.md §11 reserves for the owner
 *   * it cannot be forgotten, because the rollback is in the `finally`
 *
 * The routing flip to the memory provider lives inside the same transaction,
 * so the org's real routing configuration is never modified — the UPDATE is
 * visible only to this run and dies with it.
 *
 * The synthetic marker still goes on every client. Belt and braces: the
 * transaction protects this path, the marker protects any other.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY IT WALKS THE SEEDED TREES WHEN THE TABLE IS EMPTY
 *
 * The journeys table has no SQL seed — a row appears only once someone opens
 * the editor and saves. Refusing to run on a fresh database would make the
 * harness useless exactly when it is most useful, so the runner falls back to
 * src/journeys/seed-journeys.mjs and SAYS SO in the response `source` field.
 * It never silently mixes the two.
 *
 * "Empty" now means "empty after the demo rows are filtered out" — see
 * loadJourneys below for the whole story of what those rows did to a run.

 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS FILTERS, AND WHAT IT COST WHEN IT DID NOT
 *
 * This used to select EVERY row in the journeys table. Demo Mode seeds two
 * (src/demo/seed-ui-coverage.mjs — keys "demo-platform-nurture" and
 * "demo-platform-funding", flagged is_demo), and once those rows existed a run
 * did this:
 *
 *   1. Neither demo key is one the runner knows how to start, so no opening
 *      event was fired for either. Their nodes contain no payment step, and a
 *      payment step is the only kind that fires an event mid-walk. Zero events.
 *      Zero events means zero automations, and the screen reported
 *      "0 of 51 automations reached" — which reads as "every automation in the
 *      product is disconnected" and is not what happened at all.
 *   2. Worse, and this is the part that made it dangerous: because those two
 *      rows exist, the table was not empty, so the seeded-journeys fallback
 *      below never ran. THE SIX REAL JOURNEYS WERE NEVER TESTED. The report
 *      was of two demo rows, and nothing on it said so.
 *   3. Their steps use a different node shape entirely ({type:"wait", days:1},
 *      no cfg), which is where the report's 'wait unit "undefined"' rows came
 *      from. Removing the rows removes those findings at the source, which is
 *      the right place — the runner must never guess a missing unit.
 *
 * Excluded keys are RETURNED, not dropped quietly. A filter nobody can see is
 * the next version of this same bug.
 *
 * is_demo is NOT TRUE rather than = false on purpose: db/migrations/153 adds
 * the column with a default, but a row written before it landed can still be
 * null, and null = false is null, which excludes nothing. */
