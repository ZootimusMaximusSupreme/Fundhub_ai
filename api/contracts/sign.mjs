// GET/POST /api/contracts/sign?id=<uuid>&exp=<unix>&sig=<hex>
//
// The one endpoint a client ever touches. It is what public/contract.html talks
// to, and it is the only route in this repository besides api/documents/[id].mjs
// that serves somebody with no session at all.
//
//   GET   → { ok, contract }  the words, and whether they can still be signed.
//           Records the view: first one stamps viewed_at, every one bumps
//           view_count.
//   POST  → { ok, contract }  the signature: typed name + ticked box + the time
//           + the IP. Refused if the words have changed since they were sent.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// AUTH IS THE SIGNATURE, NOT A SESSION — copied from api/documents/[id].mjs,
// which the brief named as the pattern to follow, and for the identical reason:
// a link in an email has to work for a person who is not signed in and never
// will be, so the HMAC and its expiry ARE the credential.
//
// Consequences, all deliberate and all inherited from that file:
//
//   - FAIL CLOSED with no signing secret. No secret, no links, no signing —
//     never an unauthenticated open door. That case answers 503 not_configured,
//     because it is OUR misconfiguration and not the caller's.
//   - Constant-time signature comparison, done inside signed-link.mjs.
//   - A bad signature, an expired link, an unknown id and a draft contract are
//     ALL 404 with the same body. Distinguishing them turns this endpoint into
//     an oracle for which contract ids exist.
//   - No org_id is read from anywhere. The anonymous caller has no org, and
//     asking them to name one is an invitation to guess.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER RETURNS: sent_by, created_by, org_id, the document ids, or the
// merge values. src/contracts/sign.mjs shapes the response to the fields the
// page actually renders; the rest is internal and goes nowhere near a client.
//
// SIGNING IS A POST AND VIEWING IS A GET, and the split is not cosmetic. A GET
// is prefetched by link scanners, retried by browsers, cached and logged with
// its query string. Recording a view that way is harmless and useful. Recording
// a SIGNATURE that way would let a corporate mail scanner sign somebody's
// funding agreement for them. Same reasoning api/consent/capture.mjs and
// api/pii.mjs both record for their own writes.
