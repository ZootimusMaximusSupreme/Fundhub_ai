    /* FULFILLMENT — the next-action chip per client, plus the six tiles.
       READ ONLY, and OPT-IN.

       OPT-IN, BECAUSE MOST CALLERS DO NOT WANT IT. This block costs ELEVEN
       extra reads — ten signal reads plus the tile count. They are constant,
       not per client, so there is no N+1 here; but this endpoint is also the
       client picker on the Client Control Panel, which uses none of them. So
       it runs only when the caller asks for it with `?fulfillment=1`. Without
       that parameter this handler makes exactly the three reads it made before
       this work existed and answers exactly the body it answered before —
       every new key absent, `rollups` absent. Only the pipeline page's
       Fulfillment lens asks (public/app/data.js, FHData.clients).

       ONE PASS, NEVER A LOOP. gatherListSignals() answers for the entire page
       in one round of parallel statements keyed on `client_id = ANY(...)`.
       Nothing here queries per client.

       ALL OR NOTHING. The whole block is wrapped, and the answers are
       ASSEMBLED IN FULL BEFORE ANY OF THEM IS ATTACHED. deriveNextAction()
       never throws, but signalsForListRow() reads the client row, so a row
       that refuses part-way through the page would otherwise leave the clients
       before it carrying the new keys and the clients after it without them.
       A half-answered list is worse than an unanswered one — a screen cannot
       tell "no action" from "we never got there". Assemble, then attach, so a
       failure anywhere leaves `clients` exactly as it was mapped above, leaves
       every new key ABSENT and leaves the tiles out too.

       NOT REUSED, ON PURPOSE: `crs_count` above has no is_demo filter (Phase 0)
       and the mapped `custom_fields` turns unknown into false. The derivation
       reads a separately counted, demo-filtered credit total and the raw blob
       instead. Neither existing field is changed — both bugs are Chris's for a
       later batch. */
