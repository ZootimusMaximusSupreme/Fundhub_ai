// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED: this read surfaces an open balance next to a
// client's name so a person can ask for it on a call. It writes nothing,
// charges nothing, and takes no payment.
//
// READ-ONLY and org-scoped. Every clause carries org_id — the CSM sees the
// clients of their own company and no others.

   BALANCE COMES FROM v_invoice_aging, NOT FROM invoices. The view is the
   thing that already knows what is genuinely still owed after payments,
   refunds and reversals (db/migrations/031). Summing invoices here would be a
   second opinion on a number the database already answers, and a second
   opinion about money is a bug waiting for someone to act on it.

   NULL SURVIVES. A client with no invoices has balance_due_cents null, which
   means "nothing is owed" only after you have looked. It is not defaulted to
   zero — CLAUDE.md §12: an unknown amount must never render as a known one. */
