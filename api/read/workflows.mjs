// GET /api/read/workflows — the real workflow registry, all 53.
//
// The registry is CODE, not a database table: every workflow is an
// inngest.createFunction() export in src/workflows/*.mjs, collected in
// src/workflows/index.mjs's `functions` array. This endpoint introspects those
// live function objects (f.opts.id / f.opts.name / f.opts.triggers) rather than
// hand-maintaining a parallel list — the two drifting apart is exactly the bug
// automations.html had before this endpoint existed.
//
// WHAT THIS ENDPOINT CAN AND CANNOT SEE. Read this before adding a field.
//
// It CAN see three things, all of them real:
//   1. the registry itself, by introspection, with no database at all;
//   2. whether a row has ever landed in the org-scoped `events` table for a
//      workflow's trigger event — src/events/bus.mjs's emit() appends there
//      before it does anything else, so "has this trigger ever been recorded"
//      is answerable;
//   3. whether the environment variable that gates a given emitter is set,
//      which is the only thing an env-var check has ever been able to prove.
//
// It CANNOT see whether any workflow ever RAN. There is no run record in this
// query, because there is no run record in this database: Inngest keeps run
// history on its own side and nothing in this repo mirrors it back. Every row
// therefore carries run_records_available:false, and the screen says so out
// loud. If run history is ever mirrored into Postgres, that flag is the hook.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS FILE USED TO CLAIM, ALL OF THEM WRONG. Recorded because
// each one was on the owner's screen, in confident wording, for months.
//
//   (a) `engine_active = Boolean(process.env.INNGEST_EVENT_KEY)`, stamped on
//       every row. That variable is a SEND key. Its presence proves a key
//       exists and nothing else — not that Inngest accepted an event, not that
//       a function was invoked. The field is gone. Nothing replaced it,
//       because there was nothing honest to replace it with from here.
//
//   (b) status "live" for any workflow whose trigger event had a row in
//       `events`. "The trigger fired" and "the workflow ran" are different
//       facts and that status conflated them. Proof it mattered: on
//       2026-08-18 five events had zero rows ever (deposit.paid,
//       inquiry.removed, message.inbound, mail.response, docs.received);
//       auditors fired those five as a test and the owner's screen moved from
//       44 "live" to 49 "live". Nothing ran. The number went up because
//       somebody poked it. The status is now "trigger_seen", named so that it
//       cannot be read as "it worked".
//
//   (c) status "never_triggered" for the cron-only jobs. A clock job does not
//       write an event row — that is how clock jobs work, not a fault — so
//       contract-chaser and message-dispatch-sweeper were permanently labelled
//       dead while working normally. Cron-only workflows are now "scheduled"
//       and report their timetable. This was audit item T6-04.
//
// The old header also said none of the 47 functions had ever run because
// INNGEST_EVENT_KEY was unset. Both halves are now false: there are 53
// functions, and INNGEST_EVENT_KEY and INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY are both set on
// production (verified by name, 2026-08-19). Inngest has demonstrably executed
// function bodies. What is still UNPROVEN is whether events emitted by
// production reach Inngest at all — the event stream for the 2026-08-18
// 21:43-21:52 window carried none of the events this app emits. Do not let a
// future edit turn "we cannot see it from here" back into a green tick.

/* EVENT_EMITTERS — what actually causes each trigger event to be emitted.
//
// WHY THIS IS HAND-MAINTAINED AND NOT GREPPED. A grep-based guard would be
// confidently wrong. Almost no real emitter has the event-name literal on its
// emit() line: every webhook adapter calls emit(db, c.name, ...) where c.name
// came out of a mapToCanonical table one to three hundred lines earlier, and
// src/funding/card-stacking-rounds.mjs calls emit(db, eventName, ...) with the
// name computed from the stage. Grepping for emit(db, "round.funded" finds
// NOTHING, so a grep guard would report four working funding events as having
// no emitter. A stale hand-written map is a smaller lie than an automated one
// that is wrong by construction.
//
// What keeps it from going stale instead: src/workflows/index.test.mjs asserts
// every event any registered workflow triggers on has an entry here. Register a
// workflow listening to a new event and that test fails until somebody writes
// down how the event gets emitted.
//
// Shape: event name -> { emitters: [{ how, gate }], note }
//   how   — a plain sentence naming the code path, for a reader who does not
//           read code.
//   gate  — the environment variable that must be set for that path to work,
//           or null when the path has no gate at all. The gate's state is read
//           live from process.env at request time; it is NOT recorded here,
//           because a recorded copy of a live value is a lie with a delay.
//   note  — optional. A fact about the live rows that a reader would otherwise
//           guess wrong.
//
// An event with an empty `emitters` array means nothing in production code can
// ever emit it. That is a real finding, not a gap in this table — say it in the
// note when it happens. As of the verification date above, no event is in that
