// One client's whole money picture in one read: card payment due dates,
// recurring bills across every account, cash in and out over a window,
// utilization from three named engines, what is coming that somebody should act
// on, and what could be drawn.
//
// SIX TABLES, ONE ROUND TRIP. tradelines, card_liabilities, bank_accounts,
// recurring_bills, cashflow_reminders — read here, assembled by
// src/finance/money-map.mjs, which is pure and holds every rule. This file
// fetches and gates; it decides nothing about the numbers.
//
//
// THE ROLE GATE IS TWO CALLS, NOT ONE ARGUMENT.
//
// requireAuth's third parameter is { db, env } and goes straight to
// authenticate(), which destructures exactly those two names — a `roles` key
// there is accepted by the object literal and silently dropped.
// api/read/tradelines.mjs shipped that once and the effective rule became "any
// authenticated staff session, any role" on an endpoint serving a named client's
// credit limits. So: requireAuth, then a real requireRole().
//
// ROLE_SETS.STAFF, matching api/read/tradelines.mjs, api/read/finance-os.mjs and
// api/read/banking-surface.mjs, which serve the same rows this one gathers.
// Gating the summary more tightly than the detail would buy nothing: anyone
// refused here can read the underlying lines from the endpoints next door.
//
//
// ORG SCOPING COMES FROM THE SESSION, AND IT FAILS CLOSED.
//
// This is the part the neighbouring endpoints do not do, and it is the reason
// this file has a client lookup before it has any data query. `staff.org_id` is
// attached by requireAuth from the sessions row — it is never read from the
// query string, because a caller-supplied org id is not a scope, it is a wish.
//
// Two refusals, both deliberate:
//
//   * A session with NO org_id gets 403. Not "fall back to the default org" and
//     not "read across all orgs" — a session that cannot say which tenant it
//     belongs to may not read a named person's bank balances. Every table below
//     carries org_id (schema rule 7), so proceeding without one would mean
//     dropping the scope entirely.
//   * A client that exists in ANOTHER org gets 404, not 403. The distinction
//     between "no such client" and "that client is not yours" is only useful to
//     somebody enumerating uuids.
//
// After the check, every query is filtered on org_id AS WELL as client_id.
// Belt and braces: the client is already proven in-org, and the second filter
// means a row mis-attributed by an ingest still cannot cross a tenant boundary.
//
//
// DATE COLUMNS ARE CAST TO text IN SQL, ON PURPOSE.
//
// node-postgres parses a `date` into a Date at LOCAL midnight; readDate() then
// reads it back with toISOString(), which is UTC. East of UTC that is an
// off-by-one on a payment due date — the single most consequential number on
// this screen. `::text` removes the class of bug rather than working around it.
//
// SELECTED COLUMNS, NOT `SELECT *`. plaid_items.encrypted_access_token lives one
// join away from bank_accounts and a read endpoint has no business being one
// typo from it.
