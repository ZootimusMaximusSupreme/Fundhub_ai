// GET /api/read/affiliates — affiliates with derived balance and tier state from 033's view
//
// Read-only. Auth + role gate + pagination + redaction all come from
// src/http/read-api.mjs; this file is its SQL and nothing else. See that module

// T10-04 — THE FOUR NUMBERS ON THE AFFILIATE SCREEN
//
// public/app/affiliate.html shows REFERRED / CLICKS / CONVERTED / PAID and every
// one of them was an em dash, because this endpoint returned none of them. It
// now does. Nothing about WHO may call this changed — the screen already made
// this exact request and painted OWED from it; these are extra columns on a
// read that already happens, not a new door.
//
//
// *** REFERRALS ARE COUNTED FROM TWO SOURCES, AND THAT IS NOT BELT-AND-BRACES. ***
//
// There are two records of "who referred this client" and they disagree:
//
//   affiliate_referrals    — 033_affiliates.sql's structured model.
//   clients.custom_fields  — where the LIVE capture actually writes.
//                            src/workflows/af-02-referral-ownership-capture.mjs
//                            sets custom_fields.affiliate_tier1_owner and has
//                            never written an affiliate_referrals row.
//
// 033 backfilled the second into the first ONCE, when it ran. Every referral
// captured since that moment exists only in custom_fields. So counting
// affiliate_referrals alone would report a number that stopped growing the day
// that migration finished — a lie dressed up as a measurement, which is worse
// than the dash it replaced. Both sources are counted and de-duplicated by
// client.
//
// `referred_untracked` is how many of those referrals exist ONLY in
// custom_fields, with no referral row crediting this affiliate. Those clients
// have never been near the conversion path, so their conversion state and their
// money are genuinely UNKNOWN. The screen says so rather than folding them into
// a conversion rate that would then be wrong.
//
// The upstream defect — af-02 writing custom_fields instead of a referral row —
// is reported on the board. It is not fixed here; that file belongs to another
// thread.
//
//
// *** MONEY THAT IS UNKNOWN STAYS UNKNOWN. ***
//
// affiliate_referrals.commission_due is numeric(14,2) and NULL means "not
// calculated" — either not converted, or converted with no matching rule.
// Owner-set schedule (migration 261, 2026-08-24): Tier 1 20% / Tier 2 5%.
// A conversion with no matching rule is still counted in converted_count; its
// money is counted nowhere. `unrated_converted_count` carries that NULL to the
// screen. COALESCE(commission_due, 0) does not appear in this file and must not.
//
// PAID is a different kind of number and a real zero when it is zero:
// affiliate_payout_lines.amount is NOT NULL, so a settled total is always
// computable. `paid_runs` tells the screen whether any run has ever settled, so
// it can say "no payout run has settled yet" instead of a bare, unexplained $0.
//
// TIER. referred_count and converted_count are DIRECT referrals only — people
// who used this affiliate's own link. A 'downline' row is credit flowing up from
// a recruit's referral; it is somebody else's lead and counting it here would
// overstate this affiliate's own reach. Downline money is not lost: balance_due
// (OWED) is 033's rollup and covers every non-void tier.
