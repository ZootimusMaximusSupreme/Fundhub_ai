// GET /api/read/portal-summary — client-safe file summary for the portal.
//
// Returns pre-qual, 3-bureau + Experian business scores, client-safe document
// metadata, and whether an inquiry case is open (the portal's inquiry upload
// door hangs off that one flag). Clients read their own file only; staff may
// pass ?client_id= when previewing the portal.
//
// IT ALSO CARRIES THE THREE FACTS THE PORTAL USED TO GUESS AT (2026-09-03):
//
//   `stage`       — where the client actually is. The screen used to decide
//                   this from ONE entitlement code, so a client who had been
//                   pulled, had the call and signed a $5,000 agreement was
//                   still told "Your call is next" (walk finding F33).
//   `advisor`     — who looks after the file. The only read carrying a name was
//                   staff-gated, so a client always saw a blank one (F34).
//   `repair_path` — whether repair work belongs on this file at all. The
//                   dispute-letter authorization card was shown to everybody,
//                   including course buyers (F35).
//
// FACTS, NOT COPY. Every one of these is a boolean or a name; the words the
// client reads stay in public/app/client-portal.html. An endpoint that returns
// sentences is a second place to change the wording.

  /* FAIL CLOSED ON THE LINK, NOT ON THE PAGE.
     secretFromEnv() throws when DOCUMENT_URL_SECRET is missing or too short —
     that is the "no secret, no links" rule and it is correct. But signing runs
     inside the documents query here, so letting it throw would turn a missing
     config into a 500 for the client's ENTIRE file summary: scores, pre-qual,
     upload doors, all of it, gone because a link could not be signed. So the
     secret is checked once, up front. No secret means unsigned rows, which is
     exactly today's behaviour — the list still renders, and paintDocs() falls
     back to plain text for every row rather than offering a dead link.

     TTL: DEFAULT_TTL_SECONDS, fifteen minutes. These links are minted on every
     portal load whether or not anybody clicks one, so they are cheap to reissue
     and a reload always brings fresh ones — which argues for short. Fifteen
     minutes is the shortest window that still comfortably covers the real
     journey: land on the portal, read the page, open "Account & history",
     switch to the Documents tab, then click. Anything shorter starts expiring
     links under a client who is simply reading. Deliberately NOT the 7-day
     MAX_TTL_SECONDS: that is for a link inside an email, which has to survive a
     weekend; a link in a page the reader already has open does not.

     NO baseUrl, so the link is a same-origin PATH. Working an origin out from
     request headers means guessing a protocol — with no x-forwarded-proto it
     has to assume https, which is right behind Netlify and wrong against a
     plain-http dev server, where the link then will not load at all. The portal
     renders this link inside a page already served from this origin, so a path
     is both correct everywhere and one less thing to get wrong. */

 * already raised and already emailed.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG (walk finding, 2026-09-06). Walk1 Funding's round funded, the
 * platform raised a $5,000 success-fee invoice, marked it sent, minted a working
 * checkout link for it, and emailed her chasing payment at 11:21. She then
 * opened her portal to pay and the Payments tab showed the words "Success Fee"
 * with a DASH where the amount belongs, and under it "No payments yet". Nothing
 * on that screen has ever read the invoices table, so there was no number to
 * print and no link to click. We asked a real customer for five thousand dollars
 * and then gave her no way to hand it over.
 *
 * ONLY WHAT IS STILL OWED. open_balance is 031's computed figure — amount_due
 * minus everything paid, forced to 0 for void and written_off — so a settled or
 * cancelled invoice is simply absent rather than being listed as $0.
 *
 * THE PAY LINK IS FOUND, NOT MINTED. src/workflows/ar-collections.mjs already
 * creates one payment_links row per success-fee invoice and puts it in the chase
 * email. This is a READ endpoint: it hands back the link that exists, and null
 * when there is not one. It never creates one, never calls a provider, and a
 * link already marked paid is not offered.

 * could not check. A read that cannot answer must never come back as $0 owed.

/* portalDocuments — listClientLibrary()'s rows, narrowed back to exactly the
 * fields this endpoint has always returned, plus `download`.
 *
 * THE NARROWING IS THE SECURITY-RELEVANT PART, not a tidy-up. listClientLibrary
 * selects the registry's full public column set, which is right for its other
 * callers and wrong to hand a consumer: it carries `metadata` — for an upload
 * that holds the original filename and an `uploaded_by` object naming the STAFF
 * MEMBER's id — plus `checksum`, `generated_by`, `signer_ref`, `org_id` and
 * `current_version_id`. None of that was in this response yesterday and none of
 * it is anything a client's portal needs. Passing the rows straight through
 * would have been a quiet widening of what a consumer can read about their own
 * file and about the people handling it. The allow-list below is the whole
 * defence, so add to it only deliberately.
 *
 * ORDER AND LIMIT ARE PRESERVED DELIBERATELY. The old SELECT was
 * `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50`; listClientLibrary orders by kind and
 * takes everything. Re-sorting and slicing here keeps the portal's list in the
 * order the client already knows and keeps the payload the same size, so this
 * change adds a link and changes nothing else on the screen.
 *
 * AN EXPIRED DOCUMENT GETS NO LINK. api/documents/[id].mjs refuses an expired
 * document even with a valid signature, so a link on one of those rows would be
 * a control that cannot finish. The row still appears — an expired soft-pull
 * authorization is still something the client owns and may need to see.
