/* THE ORG COMES FROM THE SESSION AND IS REQUIRED (audit C1).
   A session with no org binds NULL, and `org_id = NULL::uuid` matches no row —
   it fails CLOSED. That is deliberate: the alternative, omitting the clause when
   the org is unknown, turns a broken session into a firehose over every
   company's rows. See src/http/read-api.mjs:150-153, which records the decision
   to leave scoping to each endpoint's own SQL — a decision that then went
   unimplemented in ten endpoints while the comment stayed. */
