/* THE ORG COMES FROM THE SESSION AND IS REQUIRED (audit C1).
   A session with no org binds NULL, and `org_id = NULL::uuid` matches no row —
   it fails CLOSED. That is deliberate: the alternative, omitting the clause when
   the org is unknown, turns a broken session into a firehose over every
   company's rows. See src/http/read-api.mjs:150-153, which records the decision
   to leave scoping to each endpoint's own SQL — a decision that then went
   unimplemented in ten endpoints while the comment stayed. */

/* ?status=open IS ANSWERED BY A BALANCE, NOT BY A STATUS (walk fix 2026-09-06).
   'open' is not one of the eight values invoices_status_check permits, so
   `v.status = 'open'` matched nothing and the AR table on ops-admin.html read
   "No unpaid invoices" while a real, sent, unpaid $5,000 invoice sat in the
   table. The vocabulary and the reasoning live in src/invoices/ar-filter.mjs;
   here it is one extra bound parameter. An unrecognised status is a 400 rather
   than an empty list, so the next screen that invents one hears about it.

   READS v_invoice_aging, NOT v_invoice_balance. The aging view is
   `SELECT b.* FROM v_invoice_balance b` plus days_overdue, is_overdue,
   aging_bucket and status_reconciled — a strict superset, no new migration, and
   the overdue arithmetic stays in the one place 031 put it instead of being
   re-derived in browser JavaScript from a due_at that is very often NULL.

   THE CLIENT'S NAME comes back because the AR table was printing a raw UUID in
   a column headed "Client". COALESCE falls back to the client code and then to
   NULL — never to a dash or a placeholder name. A screen that cannot name
   somebody has to say so itself; this endpoint will not invent one. */
