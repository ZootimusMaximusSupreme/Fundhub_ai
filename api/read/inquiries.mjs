// GET /api/read/inquiries — the inquiry-removal work queue.
//
// Read-only. Auth + role gate + pagination + redaction come from
// src/http/read-api.mjs; this file is its SQL and nothing else.
//
// NOTE ON THE SOURCE. This reads the LOCAL inquiry_log table, which is not the
// same thing as /api/inquiry — that endpoint proxies the external Airtable
// runtime and returns its shape. The screen's Work Queue columns map 1:1 onto
// inquiry_log, so it reads the table directly rather than the proxy.
//
// client_name is joined here rather than left to the caller because the screen
// shows a person, and making every consumer do a second round-trip per row to
// turn a uuid into a name is how a six-row table becomes seven requests.
