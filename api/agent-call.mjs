// POST /api/agent-call — start a phone call for a registry agent, or ask
// whether one could be started.
//
//   { action: "check", agent_code, client_id? }  → never dials. Says yes or why not.
//   { action: "call",  agent_code, client_id }   → places the call.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Nothing on this site could start a phone call from the Agent Editor until
// this route. Bureau inquiry dials live on /api/inquiry (in-repo). This route
// is for client-facing agents only (AG-04 style).
//
// This is the in-house replacement seam. It is deliberately small: it decides
// WHETHER a call may happen and records that it did. The transmission itself is
// src/messaging/providers/bland-voice.mjs, which is the only directory
// CLAUDE.md §12 permits new outbound traffic in.
//
//
// THE SCRIPT COMES FROM THE DATABASE. THAT IS THE POINT.
//
// Bland speaks `agents.prompt` — the column the Agent Editor's Save button
// writes. Before this, the words on a real call lived in a hardcoded template
// literal in vendor/inquiry-remover/src/agents/setter-prompt.js, so editing an
// agent in the CRM changed nothing a caller would hear and editing the file
// changed nothing the screen showed. One store now.
//
//
// FIVE GATES, ALL FAIL-CLOSED. A refusal is never reported as a success.
//   1. Staff session, and a role that is allowed to contact a client.
//   2. The agent is live, runs on Bland, and has a prompt (bland-voice.readiness).
//   3. The client belongs to the caller's org and has a usable phone number.
//   4. Consent: not opted out of voice, and not flagged do-not-call by voice.
//   5. The messaging gate, run over the words the robot will actually say.
// Then MESSAGING_DRY_RUN, inside the provider, holds everything unless it is
// explicitly switched off. Unset means nothing leaves.
//
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
//   - No screen calls this. Adding a "start call" button is a send control on a
//     screen no intended journey describes; that is the owner's call, and it is
//     written up on docs/workflows/fix-2026-08-18/BOARD.md rather than built.
//   - No bureau call. vendor/inquiry-remover/UPDATE-REQUIRED.md is an owner-set
//     hold: Experian now needs documents uploaded to its portal first, then a
//     wait, then the call, and the bureau prompts still describe a call-first
//     sequence. Wiring a bureau dial before those are rewritten would put a
//     robot on the phone telling a bureau an upload happened when it has not.
//     Only client-facing agents are accepted below.
//
// requireAuth then requireRole — never a roles key on requireAuth (CLAUDE.md §12).
