// GET/POST /api/social/posts — list the marketing post queue; queue, discard,
// approve or refuse.
//
// WHY approve AND reject LIVE HERE. 240 gave a post the guardrail engine held for
// a person somewhere to sit (social_posts.status = 'awaiting_approval') and
// nothing could move it out again, so every held post stayed held for good —
// including every credit_repair post, which src/compliance/screen.mjs holds
// unconditionally. This route already existed and already dispatched on
// body.action, so the two decisions are two more actions on it rather than a new
// endpoint and a new row in netlify/functions/api.mjs's ROUTES map.
//
// THE ROLE CHECK IS ITS OWN CALL. requireAuth/authenticate read only { db, env }
// and silently drop a `roles` key — the bug src/http/auth-gate.test.mjs exists to
// catch — so requireRole() is called separately, after the principal resolves.
// A PARTNER MAY NEVER APPROVE THEIR OWN POST. That is the whole point of the
// hold, so it is refused here on the server; the buttons being hidden on
// public/app/social-studio.html is a courtesy, not the gate.

   social_posts admits only draft / awaiting_approval / queued / posting / posted
   / failed / blocked (240), and marketing_content_queue only draft / queued /
   scheduled / awaiting_approval / discarded / blocked (243). The only existing
   value that means "this will never go out" is 'blocked' — so a person refusing
   a post and the automatic copy check refusing one land on the SAME word, and
   the status column alone cannot tell them apart afterwards. That is recorded,
   not hidden: no new status was invented and no migration was written for it.
   The reason below is appended to blocked_reasons so a reader can still see
   which of the two happened, because that list is what the screen prints under
   "why it was refused".

   There is no rejected_by column on either table and none was added, so WHO
   refused a post is not recorded anywhere. approved_by is not used for it: that
   column means "approved", and writing a refuser into it would be a false
   record. */
