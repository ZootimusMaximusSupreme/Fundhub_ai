//
// `deal`    is calcDeal()    from src/calculators/deal-math.mjs    — net cash, fee split, monthly obligation, the cliff

//
// *** SCAFFOLD STUB — TRACK 6 OWNS THIS FILE. ***
// Auth, role gate, org scoping, method switch and error mapping are finished and
// are the contract. Track 6 replaces the `not_implemented` body.
//
// *** POST, NOT GET, AND IT COMPUTES RATHER THAN STORES. *** Both calculators
// are pure — no database, no clock, no randomness — so this endpoint writes
// nothing. It is a POST because the input is a whole deal shape rather than a
// handful of query parameters, and because a URL carrying a named client's
// approved funding amount would land in every access log it passed through.
//
// *** THE ARITHMETIC IS NOT DONE IN THE BROWSER. *** public/app/closer-dashboard
// .html already reimplements a funding waterfall in inline JavaScript against
// sample rows, and that is exactly the drift this endpoint avoids: a second
// implementation in a <script> block is a second answer that goes stale
// (src/finance/os-grid.mjs:3). deal-model.html renders what this returns and
// decides nothing.
//
// *** THE DEPOSIT LOWERS NET CASH. IT IS NOT A DISCOUNT ON THE FEE. ***
// This was wrong until the scaffold pass fixed it, and it is the single number
// on this screen most likely to be read out loud to a client. calcDeal used to
// compute the fee taken from proceeds as `max(0, fee - downPayment)`, which
// treated the deposit as prepayment of the success fee — so paying MORE up front
// made net cash go UP. The two places that actually move money disagree:
// src/workflows/f-07-funding-locked.mjs:74 invoices the success fee as
// `approvedAmount * feePercent` with no deposit term at all, and
// db/migrations/011_sales.sql:82 makes `deposit` and `success_fee` separate,
// co-existing values of sale_payments.kind — the front end and the back end. So
// the deposit is money ON TOP of the fee, net cash is funding − fee − deposit,
// and on the worked example the old formula overstated it by $6,000. The
// regression test is 'a larger deposit LOWERS net cash to the client' in
// src/calculators/deal-math.test.mjs. Do not reintroduce the offset.
//
// *** THE GUARDRAIL MEASURES THE DELTA, NOT THE ABSOLUTE. *** calcFunding's hard
// stop fires when THIS DRAW pushes utilization across the threshold, not when
// the client is already over it. A client sitting at 38% on existing balances
// would fail an absolute 30% gate forever, at zero draw — that is a pre-existing
// condition, not a reason to block this deal. Render `hardStop` and
// `preExistingOver` as the different things they are.
//
// *** UNKNOWN MUST SURVIVE. *** Both calculators return null for anything that
// depends on a missing input — a card with no credit limit contributes no
// headroom, an unpriced line is never offered as the cheapest money. The screen
// renders null as an em dash. Never 0.00, and never a coalesced default.

 *     therefore a FLOOR whenever one exists, which is exactly what the "+"
 *     marker in finance-os.css means. Counting them here is what lets the screen
 *     mark the row without recomputing anything.
 *
 *   * A CARD WITH NO RECORDED BALANCE arrives at the calculator as a balance of
 *     ZERO — toCalculatorCards maps `fromCents(r.balance_cents) ?? 0`
 *     (src/tradelines/index.mjs:169), a known loss already written up in
 *     src/alerts/evaluate.mjs:120. That makes its utilization read 0% and the
 *     guardrail OPTIMISTIC about it: the one direction a safety gate must not be
 *     wrong in. The loss cannot be recovered downstream — by then a real zero
 *     and an unknown are the same number — so it is counted HERE, from the rows,
 *     and reported so the screen can say the verdict rests on a balance nobody
 *     has recorded. Fixing it belongs in toCalculatorCards, which several other
 *     callers depend on; it is named in the track report rather than changed
 *     underneath them.
 *
 * `current_balance` in the list is null for those cards, NOT the zero the
 * calculator saw, because this list is what a person reads.

/* ═══════════════════════════ the explainable lines ═══════════════════════════
 *
 * netCashLines — the same four numbers calcDeal already returned, laid out as
 * the separate lines they are, plus the one line the calculator does not know
 * about.
 *
 * WHY THE LINES ARE SPLIT OUT AT ALL. "The client walks away with $222,000" is a
 * sentence somebody says out loud on a call, and the only defence against saying
 * a wrong one is being able to read the subtraction: this much came in, this
 * much was the fee, this much was the deposit. A single unexplained difference
 * is a number people either trust or ignore, and both are wrong.
 *
 * EXISTING DEBTS ARE NOT IN calcDeal AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Nothing in this
 * repository stores, bills or schedules a debt payoff — sale_payments has
 * deposit, installment, success_fee and refund and no fifth kind
 * (db/migrations/011_sales.sql:82) — so a payoff is an assumption the operator
 * typed into a box on a screen, not a term of the deal. Putting it inside the
 * calculator would make it look like one, and every other caller of calcDeal
 * would inherit a parameter with nothing behind it. It is subtracted here, in
 * the open, labelled with where it came from, and it is null — not zero — when
 * nobody typed one, because "no payoff was entered" and "the payoff is nothing"
 * are different statements and the screen shows the first as an em dash. */
