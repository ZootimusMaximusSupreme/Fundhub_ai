// requestMagicLink() hands back an `outcome` saying whether the address matched
// an account, matched a client, or matched nothing. NONE of that reaches the
// response. Not in a field, not in a different status code, not in a reworded
// message. A caller who can tell "we sent it" from "there is nobody here" has a
// form that answers the question "is this person a Fundhub client?" for any
// address they care to type — which for a consumer-finance product is a list
// worth money to the wrong buyer.
//
// It is the same discipline loginAccount() already keeps by returning one error
// for an unknown email and a wrong password, and the reason this handler must
// not "helpfully" forward what the service layer knows.
//
// THE 429 IS UNIFORM TOO. The limiter counts request ROWS, and a request writes
// a row whether or not the address matched anything (117_account_magic_links).
// So a stranger's address throttles on exactly the same schedule a customer's
// does, and the throttle cannot be used to sort one from the other.
