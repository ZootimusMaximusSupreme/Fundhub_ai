// POST /api/auth/send-portal-link — an owner or admin mails a client the link
// that gets them into their portal.
//
// { client_id } → { ok, sent, url, expiresAt }
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The self-serve reset screen tells a client "Nothing was sent.
// Ask an owner or admin for a reset link" — and there was no control anywhere in
// the CRM that could send one. Walk finding F31, 2026-09-03: every client who
// bought was given an active portal account with a password hash nobody holds,
// and no way to be handed a credential for it.
//
// SEPARATE FILE, WHOLE-ROUTE GATE — the same reasoning as api/auth/admin-reset.mjs
// next door. requireRole is called unconditionally at the top so the gate is one
// statically traceable fact about this file; scripts/journeys/extract.mjs reads
// that literally, and a gate hidden inside a branch is the shape it cannot trace
// (CLAUDE.md §4).
//
// THE LINK COMES BACK IN THE RESPONSE, and that matches admin-reset exactly: the
// caller is an authenticated owner or admin, the email is queued but the
// dispatcher is a separate scheduled act (CLAUDE.md §12), and the whole point of
// this control is that a person on the phone can read the link out now. It is a
// bearer credential, so it is short-lived and single-use like every other one.
//
// NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS. issuePortalLinkForClient() calls sendTemplated(), which
// writes a `messages` row with status='queued' and stops.
