   GET — "what sign-in options does this deploy offer?"
   THE SERVER DECIDES WHETHER THE DEMO PANEL EXISTS. THE BROWSER ONLY DRAWS IT.

   WHY THIS IS A SERVER ANSWER AND NOT A CONSTANT IN THE PAGE. public/login.html
   used to carry the nine addresses and the shared password as a JavaScript
   literal, and hide them behind a <details> the browser rendered unconditionally.
   That is a published credential on a static file: `curl https://…/login.html`
   returns it whether or not DEMO_LOGINS_ENABLED is set, and it stays returned on
   the day the flag is switched off in production because nobody redeploys the
   HTML to take a password out of it. Serving the roster from here means the
   whole panel — every address, the password, the buttons — simply is not in the
   response when the switch is off. Off is nothing to read, not something hidden.

   WHY IT LIVES ON THIS FILE RATHER THAN A NEW ONE. netlify/functions/api.mjs
   holds a hardcoded ROUTES map and a handler absent from it 404s (CLAUDE.md §12
   — it has shipped twice). That file belongs to another workflow in this tree
   and is not edited from here, so a new api/auth/demo-logins.mjs would be
   unreachable. `auth/login` is already routed and ROUTES dispatches on PATH
   ONLY, so every method reaches this handler — GET included, where it was
   answering 405. A GET on the login resource returning the ways you may log in
   is the honest reading of that URL anyway.

   IT AUTHENTICATES NOTHING AND TOUCHES NO DATABASE. It reads one environment
   variable and a frozen array. With the switch off it also reveals nothing: the
   reply is the same two words whether or not any demo row was ever seeded.

  /* LOG THE REAL CAUSE BEFORE IT BECOMES A GENERIC 500.
     netlify/functions/api.mjs:501 already catches any thrown error here,
     scrubs it (safeError — never a host, DSN or password) and answers a
     clean internal_error to the caller. What it does NOT do is put the cause
     anywhere an operator can find it — nothing in this repo has metrics or
     error reporting (CLAUDE.md §12), so a thrown error was previously visible
     nowhere at all. This try/catch adds exactly that, to Netlify's function
     logs only, and then RE-THROWS unchanged so the dispatcher's existing
     scrub-and-500 behaviour is the one and only thing that decides what the
     caller sees. Nothing about the HTTP response changes here. */
