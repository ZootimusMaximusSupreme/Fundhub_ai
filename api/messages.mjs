// The work is in src/messaging/compose.mjs. This file is the door: it decides
// who may knock, reads the body, and turns the service's answer into a status
// code. Everything about how a message is queued, gated, threaded and sent is
// over there, where it can be tested without an HTTP layer.
//

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// STAFF ONLY, AND ON THE CLOCK.
//
// requirePrincipal(["staff"]) — named explicitly, not inherited. A client or
// affiliate session that could POST here would be able to send messages to
// other people's clients as the company. There is no reading of this endpoint
// under which a non-staff principal belongs.
//
// requireActiveShift — because the owner named this endpoint before it existed.
// The rule, verbatim: "Gate writes that affect attribution or pay: claiming a
// lead, logging a call outcome, moving a pipeline stage, SENDING CLIENT
// MESSAGES. Do not gate read-only screens."
//
// src/http/middleware/ACTIVE-SHIFT-ROLLOUT.md records that two of the owner's
// four categories had no endpoint in this repository at all, and names client
// messaging as one of them: "pipeline-stage moves and client messaging both
// happen inside Inngest workflows and webhook handlers, which have no staff
// principal." This is that endpoint arriving. It has a staff principal, it
// writes sender_staff_id, and it files a `text_sent` row against the shift —
// so it is the case the rule was written for, and it is gated on the rule that
// already exists rather than on a new judgement.
//
// The gate is FIRST in the POST branch, before the body is read: whether you
// may write at all is not a question about the payload. It writes its own
// refusal — including the 503 for "I could not check", which must never
// collapse into "you are not clocked in" — so `if (!shift) return;` is the
// whole contract.
//
// THE READS ARE NOT GATED. This file has no GET. The thread and the inbox are
// api/read/messages.mjs and api/read/inbox.mjs, and the same rule ends "do not
// gate read-only screens" — an employee coming back from lunch can see what
// came in before they clock in, and cannot answer it until they do.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THE OUTCOME MEANS TO THE CALLER, AND WHY IT IS NOT A BOOLEAN.
//
// 200 does not mean "delivered". It means the message was accepted, recorded,
// and put through the dispatcher — and `outcome` says what the dispatcher did
// with it. A held message is not an error: the request was valid, the row
// exists, and an operator can see it. Returning 4xx for "held until 11am" would
// tell the screen the send failed, and the staff member would type it again.
//
//   sent        gone to the provider
//   deferred    SMS inside quiet hours; queued for 11:00 Eastern
//   blocked     the gate refused it — opted out, or restricted wording
//   no_route    no provider is routed for this channel in this company
//   no_address  the client record has no phone/email to send to
//   retry       the provider failed in a way worth retrying; still queued
//
// The screen prints these in plain words. See public/app/messaging.html.
