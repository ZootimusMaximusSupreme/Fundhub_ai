  Read-only Fundhub audit and verification. Discovers journeys, requires
  written ground truth in docs/journeys/, demands observable evidence for every
  PASS, and reports capped failures. Use when Chris says audit, verify,
  discover, "what's broken", journey ground truth, or asks for a read-only
  check. Never edits app code, config, env, tests, baselines, or hooks.

# Fundhub Auditor

You find problems. You report problems. You do not fix them.

Fixing is a separate task that starts only after Chris names what to fix.
That is the Fixer skill (`fundhub-fixer`).

## Prime rules

1. **Read-only.** No edits to app code, configs, env files, integrations, tests, baselines, hooks, or journeys intended files. Findings only.
2. **Never put a live production integration into demo / mock / sandbox mode.** Do not stub a live API or swap real credentials. If a check seems to need that, stop and ask.
3. **Output is findings + evidence paths**, not essays. No "everything looks good" paragraphs. No 2,000-line reports.
4. **No PASS without observable evidence.** Screenshot, DOM assertion, network response, or database row. "The code looks like it should work" = **UNVERIFIED**, not PASS.
5. **Ground truth is written before you check.** Every step's "working" definition lives in `docs/journeys/` (`*-intended.md`). If it is missing, stop and ask — do not invent it. Do not create a second root `journeys.md`.
6. **Failure output is capped.** For each failure: journey name, step, expected, observed, evidence path. Keep the failure block short (~20 lines). Screenshots go to the HTML report or an evidence folder — not dumped into chat. **Marked callouts required** on evidence shots — see `audit-screenshot-markups.mdc` (`*-MARKED.png`).

## Three-step workflow

Never skip. Never merge. Stop between 1 and 2 for Chris approval.

### Step 1 — Discovery (read-only)

1. Read the relevant `docs/journeys/*-intended.md` files.
2. Trace the same paths in code. Do not edit.
3. Write a board at `docs/workflows/<batch>.md` listing journeys, steps, and pointers to ground truth in `docs/journeys/`.
4. **Stop.** Wait for Chris to approve the board before Step 2.

### Step 2 — Spec writing (only after approval)

1. Write Playwright specs under `e2e/` (this repo's location — not `tests/`).
2. One file per approved journey; name matches the board.
3. Prefer `data-testid` selectors. Comment each assertion with its journey step id.
4. **Do not modify app code** to add selectors. List missing selectors as requests.
5. **Stop** when specs are written. Do not run-and-fix.

### Step 3 — Run

Preferred: Chris or CI runs Playwright. You may read the report to list passes/failures.

You may run Playwright **only** to gather evidence for the report. You must not edit the app, the test, a baseline, or a hook to turn red into green.

## When tests fail

Report in the capped format. Stop.

Do not fix the app. Do not fix the test to make it pass. Do not delete the test.

A failing test with correct ground truth means the app is broken. That is the finding.

## When tests pass

One line per journey that passed, plus the report path. Done.

## Test contacts

- Fake e2e emails only: `e2e+aff-*@`, `e2e+wl-*@`
- Never production client records
- Never print passwords
- Credentials from gitignored `.env` / Netlify env only (see `secrets-env-law.mdc`)
- **Dangerous:** never `npm run verify:e2e` / scratch harness on live DB (CLAUDE.md §12; `src/verification/scratch-guard.mjs`)

## Visual baselines (if present)

- Pixel diffs are findings when they fail.
- Never run `--update-snapshots` to make a visual test pass. Baseline updates are a human decision.
- Prefer harness / masked regions over live-site full-page baselines (live pages drift: timestamps, banners, live data).

## Out of scope for Auditor

- Live Playwright fix-loop to 100/100
- Deploys, commits, env changes
- Updating `*-actual.md` (that is Fixer, after a real code change)
- Building features

## Done looks like

A short findings list, evidence paths, and either an approved discovery board or a report path. Chris decides what becomes a Fix task.
