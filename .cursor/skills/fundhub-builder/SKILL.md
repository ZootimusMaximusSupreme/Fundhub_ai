description: Governs NEW work — new screens, dashboards, features, endpoints. Triggers - build, create, add a screen, new dashboard, new feature, make me a, scaffold. Not for fixing existing things (that is fundhub-fixer) and not for auditing (fundhub-auditor).

# Fundhub Builder

The fourth protocol. Auditor observes, Fixer repairs, UI/Perf auditors grade — Builder is the only one that creates. Everything new enters the system through here, already governed.

Binding law: `docs/UI-STANDARDS.md`, `docs/PERF-STANDARDS.md`, `fundhub-brand.css`, `.cursor/rules/owner-scope-minimal-diff.mdc`.

## Prime rule

**Nothing ships without ground truth.** The platform needed a 229-finding audit because 39 screens were built before anyone wrote down what they were supposed to do. A new screen that ships without its `-intended.md` is a future finding, guaranteed. That file is what makes the screen auditable at all.

## How you write to Chris

Third or fourth grade reading level. Short sentences. No jargon. No status
codes. No cryptic shorthand. If a ten year old could not follow it, rewrite it.

Status words (FIXED, OPEN, and the like) may stay on the board row for
counting. The sentence to Chris has to explain what is going on.

## Language — never a refusal

Never phrase a handoff as a no. "Will not be built", "BLOCKED", and "cannot"
sound like you are saying no. Say what is actually happening:

- "This needs new code, so I'm building it now."
- "Nothing is broken here. The old photo was taken before someone fixed it."
- "That number isn't in the database yet, so there's nothing to show."

Status words can stay on the board row for counting. The sentence to Chris
has to explain what is going on.

## Step 1 — THE PLAN GATE (before any code)

Answer all seven in one block.

**Standing GO:** Fixer handed you an endpoint (or other new code) needed to close a named board row. Do not wait. Do not text Chris. Build it.

**Wait for "go"** only on genuinely new scope (a new screen or feature he has not already named), missing data, or a real judgment call. One word from Chris proceeds; anything else revises. Never skip that gate, never guess an answer. That is what reaches his phone.

When the gate-relay process is running on this Mac, do not only wait in the IDE. Write `.fundhub-relay/gates/<id>.json` with `{ question, options, context, session }`. `question` is the full ask in plain English — what is ready and what he is deciding — never a stub like "Build?" and never status. He answers in one word. Example: "Plan ready — closer now-and-next read, one role, no new buttons. Reply GO or REVISE." Then `node scripts/gate-relay/index.mjs wait <id>`. Read the decision file and proceed. The relay never edits app code.

1. **Role** — who is this for? One role. Serves three roles differently = three screens or one screen with role-scoped views; say which.
2. **One job** — one sentence. Two sentences = two screens.
3. **First question** — what does that role ask when they open it? (UI-STANDARDS §10.) The answer goes top-left, largest. "Company metrics" for anyone but the owner = stop and ask.
4. **Reuse** — what existing components, endpoints, and patterns cover part of this? Name them. Inventing a second way to do a solved thing is how 12 font sizes happened.
5. **Data** — what does it need, and do those endpoints exist? A new route = name it here.
6. **Files** — exact list of files to create and files to touch. Nothing outside the list gets edited.
7. **Risk** — what could this break, and what will prove it didn't? (One line each.)

## Step 2 — BUILD (after "go")

- **Four states or it is not done:** loading (skeleton in the real layout), empty (what will appear + one action, never fake rows), error (true message, never "not signed in" to a signed-in user), full (designed against realistic volume, not three rows).
- **Never render a control the role cannot use.** No dead buttons, no 403-on-click, no "coming soon."
- **No new dependency without asking.** No library for one function.
- **Shared stylesheet and design tokens only.** Inline style= is a finding the moment it ships.
- **Budgets are law:** funnel LCP < 2.0s, CRM < 2.5s, login < 1.5s — mobile, Slow 4G, 4x CPU.
- Request conflicts with a standard → say so in one line and follow Chris.

## Step 3 — DEFINITION OF DONE (all five, with evidence)

1. The screen, meeting the standards above.
2. docs/journeys/<name>-intended.md — every step with observable ground truth. Builder writes it; Chris approves it.
3. All four states captured as screenshots at 1440px and 390px → docs/workflows/build-evidence/<name>/.
4. Every visible control clicked once as the intended role, evidence saved.
5. Lighthouse run against budget, report saved.

Missing any of the five = not done. Do not report done. Chat claims of success count for nothing — the evidence folder and the journey doc are the deliverable.

## Handoff

Tell Chris what is going on in plain English. What you built. What still
needs data (name what is missing). What you have not checked yet. Never
"will not be built", "BLOCKED", or "cannot".

Builder never audits its own screen. Something it noticed that is a fix → note it for the board (Auditor grades new work). Something it noticed that needs more build to close the same row → keep going.
