// The live dashboard's numbers. Real rows, or nothing.
//
// THIS IS THE PRODUCT. A person pays $297 to watch their own name book calls
// for a week. Every figure on this screen is a count of rows that exist, scoped
// to their partner id. There is no sample data path, no demo mode, and no
// modelled figure anywhere in this file.
//
// NO EARNINGS CLAIMS, AND THE RULE HAS TEETH HERE. There are zero measured paid
// closes on record, so this module may return THIS buyer's own numbers and
// nothing else — never a typical result, never a range, never another buyer's
// result, never a projection of what the week will produce. If a caller wants a
// benchmark, the honest answer is that none exists.
//
// ZERO IS A REAL ANSWER AND IT IS RENDERED AS ZERO. A trial with no booked calls
// shows zero booked calls. Hiding it behind an empty state, or filling it with
// something from another partner, would be the one lie this screen could tell.
//
// NULL SURVIVES. Spend is NULL — not 0 — when no metrics have synced yet,
// because "we have not heard from the platform" and "the platform says you
// spent nothing" are different facts and the second one has a refund
// conversation attached to it.
//
// SCOPE. Every query carries org_id AND partner_id. bookings has no partner
// column, so booked calls are reached through clients.partner_id, which
// 042_partners.sql calls "the whole tenancy model" and indexes for exactly this.
