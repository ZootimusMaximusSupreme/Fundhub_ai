// What FundHub owes when the trial books nothing.
//
// TWO PROMISES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME PROMISE.
//
// 1. THE DAY-1 GUARANTEE — unconditional, and it is about FundHub's own work.
//    If the branded page, the ad set, the live dashboard and the campaign are
//    not delivered by the end of day one, every dollar goes back, automatically,
//    without the buyer asking. That is defensible because all four are things
//    FundHub controls completely.
//
// 2. THE ZERO-CALL REMEDY — conditional, and it is SERVICE, NOT CASH.
//    The $297 buys the machine. It cannot buy a booked call, because the number
//    of calls depends on the ad budget the BUYER controls, the market they
//    picked, and the platform's own delivery. Promising a result FundHub does
//    not control is how a good offer becomes a refund machine. So a trial that
//    ran properly and booked nothing gets: a written breakdown of why, seven
//    more days of the machine, and the $297 credited in full toward the $10,000
//    if they join within 30 days.
//
// EVERY CONDITION IS MEASURABLE FROM DATA FUNDHUB ALREADY HOLDS. Spend comes
// from ad_metrics_daily, the campaign's own status from campaigns.status, and
// the account's state from ad_platform_connections.connection_state. Nobody
// argues about whether the campaign was paused — the system knows.
//
// THIS FILE DECIDES. IT DOES NOT PAY. A cash refund is a payments row of kind
// 'refund' written on the existing rail; there is no refund table here and none
// should ever be invented. Whether a refund can be INITIATED from FundHub, or
// must be done by hand in the Commas dashboard, is unverified — see
// REFUND_INITIATION_UNVERIFIED below. Nothing in this module claims otherwise.
