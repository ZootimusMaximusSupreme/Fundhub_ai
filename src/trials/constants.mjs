// The Live Trial — the numbers, the names, and the words that are fixed.
//
// $297 buys seven days in which FundHub builds and runs the buyer's first ad
// campaign under the buyer's brand. Day 8 they pay $10,000 and become a partner,
// or they walk away KEEPING every lead the trial produced, paid at the standard
// affiliate 20% on the ones FundHub closes. Spec: docs/specs/W4-live-trial.md.
//
// MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS. Every figure below is cents and stays cents until
// src/commissions/money.mjs formats it. fromCents() returns a STRING — never do
// arithmetic on its output.
//
// WHY THE PRICES ARE HERE AND NOT IN src/config/offers.mjs. offers.mjs is the
// catalogue and it is owned by the checkout unit; the LIVE_TRIAL and
// PARTNER_ENTRY entries land there. This module must not fork that catalogue,
// so instead of copying it silently, drift is a TEST FAILURE:
// src/trials/offer-drift.test.mjs reads offers.mjs and fails if an entry exists
// there with a different price to the one below. Two numbers that disagree is
// the bug; two numbers that must agree, with a test holding them together, is a
// seam.
//
// NO EARNINGS CLAIMS. There are zero measured paid closes on record, so nothing
// in this module — or anything built on it — may state, imply or model a booked
// call rate, a typical result, a range, or another buyer's result. The only
// numbers a buyer ever sees are their own, after they happen.
