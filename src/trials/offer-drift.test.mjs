// The seam between this unit's numbers and the price catalogue.
//
// src/config/offers.mjs is the single source of prices and it is owned by the
// checkout unit; src/trials/constants.mjs carries the same two numbers so this
// module can be built and tested before those entries land. TWO NUMBERS THAT
// MUST AGREE NEED SOMETHING HOLDING THEM TOGETHER, or they drift and the trial
// charges one price while the page shows another.
//
// So: if offers.mjs has the entry, its price must match. If it does not have it
// yet, that is reported as a pending integration rather than a failure — the
// entry is another unit's to add.
