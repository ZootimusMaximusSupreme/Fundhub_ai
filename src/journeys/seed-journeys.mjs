/* The six journey trees, server-side.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS A COPY
 *
 * The journeys editor (public/app/journeys.html) carries these six trees in a
 * client-side seed() function, and the journeys table (migration 106) has no
 * SQL seed at all — a row only appears once someone opens the editor and
 * saves. So on a fresh database there is nothing for a runner to walk.
 *
 * This is the server-side copy the runner falls back to when the table is
 * empty. It is EXTRACTED from journeys.html, never retyped: the extraction is
 * re-run by seed-journeys.test.mjs on every test run, which deep-compares this
 * data against what the editor actually seeds and fails on any drift. The
 * duplication is real, but it cannot rot silently.
 *
 * THE PRE-EXISTING DUPLICATION IS NOT FIXED HERE. The right end state is that
 * journeys.html fetches its seed from the server rather than carrying its own,
 * which would delete one of the two copies. That is a change to a live editor
 * screen and outside this ticket — recorded as a finding rather than done
 * quietly. See the run report.
 *
 * Node shape, verbatim from the editor:
 *   { id, type, title, cfg, touches: [[category, label], ...], branches? }
 * The `branches` key is present only on a condition node: exactly two lanes,
 * each { label, nodes }. Lane labels are arbitrary per node — the seed uses
 * Yes/No on four conditions and Qualified/Not yet on the closer's.
