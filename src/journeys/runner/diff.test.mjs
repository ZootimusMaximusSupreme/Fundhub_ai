/* Intent versus code.
 *
 * The two canaries this file exists for, both known-true findings, so a diff
 * that misses either is not actually checking anything:
 *
 *   1. "Sales Manager" — the editor offers it, the code has no such role.
 *   2. ['Screen','Affiliate portal — not built yet'] — a gap already sitting
 *      in the data as plain text that nothing reads.
 *
 * CANARY 1 IS PINNED TO A FIXTURE, DELIBERATELY. The sales_manager role is
 * being built in this same change. A test that read the live ROLE_SETS would
 * stop catching anything the moment it landed — the check would go green
 * because the finding was fixed, not because the checker works. So the fixture
 * below hardcodes a role list without sales_manager and asserts the diff flags
 * it. That assertion stays true forever, whatever the real role list does.
