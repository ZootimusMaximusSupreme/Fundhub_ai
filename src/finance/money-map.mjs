// Money Map — one client's whole money picture, assembled once, server-side.
//
// WHAT THIS ANSWERS. Six questions an owner otherwise needs six screens for:
//   1. when is every card payment due
//   2. what bills repeat, across every account
//   3. money in, money out, what is left, over a window
//   4. how hard is each card being leaned on, and the portfolio overall
//   5. what is coming that somebody should act on
//   6. how much could be drawn, and what would a draw cost
//
// WHY A MODULE AND NOT BROWSER JS. Same reason src/finance/os-grid.mjs gives:
// closer-dashboard.html reimplements a funding waterfall in an inline <script>
// against sample rows, and that second implementation is a second answer that
// goes stale. Everything here is computed once, unit-tested without a browser,
// and shipped to the page already formed. public/app/money-map.html renders; it
// decides nothing.
//
//
// THIS MODULE DECIDES ALMOST NOTHING EITHER — AND THAT IS THE POINT.
//
// Every rule below already had an owner, and this file calls that owner rather
// than restating it. Two copies of "a total with holes in it is a floor" would
// drift, and drift is the defect class this repository keeps finding.

// ATTRIBUTION IS A HARD REQUIREMENT, NOT A NICETY.
//
// Three separate engines in this repository have an opinion about utilization
// and they do not agree, on purpose:
//
//   * src/alerts/evaluate.mjs   compares in integers, rounds to 4dp, and returns
//                               `over: null` when ANY line is unknown, because an
//                               unknown line can move the aggregate either way.
//   * src/finance/os-grid.mjs   returns a display string and a basis, and marks
//                               a partial total as a floor.
//   * src/calculators/deal-funding.mjs rounds to 2dp and measures the DELTA a
//                               draw causes rather than the absolute level.
//
// A screen that printed "utilization" once, unlabelled, would be picking one of
// three answers at random. So every utilization reading in this payload carries
// an `engine` id and an `engine_label`, and the screen prints the label next to
// the number. Same for alerts, which come from two places that must not be
// confused: rows already stored in `cashflow_reminders`, and outflows the
// projection placed on days inside the window.
//
//
// NULL MEANS UNKNOWN AND MUST SURVIVE TO THE SCREEN.
//
// Every money figure is carried twice: `*_cents` (integer or null) and a
// `*_display` string produced by fromCents(). A null display renders as an em
// dash, never as "0.00". `fromCents` RETURNS A STRING — nothing in this file
// does arithmetic on its output, and the integer field beside it is what any
// caller should compute with.
//
//
// PURE. No I/O, no clock, no randomness. `asOf` is a parameter. Everything here
// is therefore testable without Postgres and without a browser, which is the
// only reason any of it can be trusted.
