// THE COORDINATOR. One pull, one stored result, one event.
//
// It orders every bureau, hands the answers to coordinateCrsResult() to be
// stored, and emits one event to say the row exists. It does not decide who to
// pull, it does not decide what the result means, and it does not write to the
// database itself.
//
// WHY IT DOES NOT WRITE. There were already two half-paths to a stored credit
// result and calling both wrote the row twice: recordPull() stored and ingested
// but emitted nothing, while the analysis.completed handler emitted and stored
// AGAIN — a second row with no tradelines and no ledger link, newer than the
// real one, so every "latest pull" reader would have picked the emptier of the
// two. coordinateCrsResult() in src/finance/soft-pulls.mjs closed that: it
// anchors the row on the provider's own response id, stores it, closes the
// request and ingests the tradelines in ONE transaction, and refuses a second
// result for the same request. This file uses it and adds nothing of its own.
//
// THE TIER ENGINE RUNS AFTER THE ROW IS STORED. crs-tier.mjs unwraps the raw
// Softview bodies under result.bureaus.TU|EX|EQ and calls the vendored
// runCRSEngine (normalizeSoftPull → routeOutcome). analysis.completed still
// means "the bureaus answered"; decision.rendered means "we chose a tier".
// emitCrsResult() is not used here — it would emit analysis.completed a second
// time on top of finishStored.
//
// PARTIAL PULLS ARE REAL RESULTS. Two bureaus answering and one failing is a
// worse answer than three, but it is still an answer, and the failure is stored
// beside the data. All three failing is not a result: the request is closed as
// failed and no row is written, because a row with no payload would read as "we
// pulled and they have no credit".
//
// REHEARSING A PULL WITHOUT TOUCHING A BUREAU (`simulate: true`).
//
// On the live site the configured host is the CRS production host and live
// pulls are on, so the first tap that clears the consent gate and the identity
// gate is a real bureau request against a real person. Nobody could walk the
// screen once before doing that to somebody. `simulate: true` fixes that, and
// it replaces EXACTLY ONE THING: the crs.orderPrequal() call at THE FENCE
// below. Everything on the near side of that line still happens for real —
// the consent gate (already passed in requestSoftPull before this function is
// called), the ledger claim, the CRS configuration check, the SSN decryption
// and its access-log row, the identity gate, the stored result row, the
// tradeline ingest, the tier engine and both events.
//
// THREE STATES, NOT TWO. `simulate` is read by simulationModeFor(): exactly
// `true` simulates, absent/null/`false` is a real pull, and ANYTHING ELSE
// refuses the pull outright. A value nobody can read as a clear yes or a clear
// no must not fall to either — falling to "real" would put a bureau request on
// someone's file that the caller never asked for, and falling to "simulated"
// would hand back a fabricated report to somebody who wanted a real one.
//
// THE STAMP. A simulated pull is stamped in five places, and the stored payload
// is the authority — a replay re-reads the stamp off the row rather than
// trusting the caller's argument:
//   crs_results.provider            "crs_softview_simulated", not "crs_softview"
//   crs_results.provider_result_id  "crs-simulated-bundle:<hash>"
//   result.simulated                true, plus result.simulatedNotice
//   result.environment              "sandbox" — see WHY SANDBOX below
//   both event payloads             simulated: true
//
// WHY THE STAMP REUSES THE WORD "sandbox". `result.environment` is not read as
// "which machine answered"; every reader of it in this repo reads it as "may I
// paint this as the client's own credit file", and the answer they already
// recognise is the string "sandbox" (src/http/client-detail.mjs:76 and :242
// both skip on it). A simulated payload is unsafe to paint for exactly the same
// reason a sandbox fixture is, so it says the word those readers already know
// instead of inventing a second one every reader would have to be taught. The
// true host class is not lost — it is kept beside it as result.hostEnvironment.
// `result.simulated` is what tells a simulated payload apart from a genuine
// sandbox pull.
//
// AND WHY THAT DOES NOT BLANK A SCREEN. The skip in client-detail.mjs walks
// backwards through the client's pull history for the newest result it is
// allowed to paint, so a simulated pull lands in the history without hiding the
// real pull underneath it. What a rehearsal will NOT do is paint new numbers on
// the client screen — see WHAT A SIMULATED PULL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
//
// WHAT A SIMULATED PULL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Two things, both because they
// would leave fabricated data somewhere that cannot carry the stamp:
//
//   1. It invents no numbers. The canned bureau answer has no scores, no
//      tradelines, no inquiries and no public records — see
//      simulatedBureauResponse. Every step still runs, including the tradeline
//      ingest; there is simply nothing for it to insert.
//   2. It does not write clients.outcome_tier — see persistOutcomeTier.
//
// So a rehearsal proves the whole path works and changes no number anyone acts
// on. The tier it produces will be MANUAL_REVIEW, because a file with no scores
// is what the engine was handed.
