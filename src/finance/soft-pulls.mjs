// Soft pulls — the on-demand path. A client whose file is already open needs an
// updated credit picture; somebody taps once; a request is recorded; when an
// answer arrives it lands through the ingest path that already exists.
//
// *** NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS. ***
// There is no outbound `fetch()` in src/adapters/ or src/lib/ and this module
// does not add one. requestSoftPull() writes a row with status='queued' and
// stops, exactly as sendTemplated() (src/workflows/messaging.mjs) writes a
// `messages` row with provider='internal', status='queued' and stops. The
// provider call is a named, documented seam below — see PROVIDER SEAM. Nobody
// should read "queued" as "sent"; today it means "recorded, and nobody has asked
// a bureau anything".
//
//
// THE FIVE RULES THIS MODULE ENFORCES, rather than trusting callers to remember:
//
//   0. NO CONSENT, NO REQUEST. Rule 1 records who asked. This one asks whether
//      the CONSUMER ever agreed. They are different questions and the platform
//      could previously only answer the first: consent lived in a CRM text
//      column (clients.cf_crs_softpull_consent), which cannot say what the
//      person was shown, how they said yes, or whether they have since said no.
//      db/migrations/099_client_consents.sql makes it a real record and
//      src/consent/index.mjs is the gate. requestSoftPull() refuses without a
//      live consent, BEFORE the replay and open-request guards, and a revoked
//      consent fails from the instant it is revoked — the check is a read at
//      request time, not a flag copied onto anything.
//
//      THE GATE IS ON REQUEST ONLY. fulfilSoftPull(), recordPull() and the CRS
//      ingest path are deliberately untouched: a pull that already happened is
//      a fact, and refusing to store or normalise it because the paperwork is
//      now wrong would lose the only copy of what a bureau said about a person
//      — see recordPull()'s own note on why `requestId` is optional. Consent
//      governs whether we may ASK. It does not govern whether we may write down
//      an answer that already arrived.
//
//   1. NO ATTRIBUTION, NO PULL. A soft pull is a consumer-credit event. Every
//      request records who initiated it and why, and a request that cannot say
//      either is REFUSED — the same position revealSsn() takes in
//      src/pii/index.mjs ("an unattributed reveal is not loggable"), and for the
//      same reason: a log nobody can trace back to a person is paperwork, not an
//      audit trail. 077 backs this with a CHECK constraint, so the refusal holds
//      even for a writer that does not come through this module.
//
//   2. ONE TAP IS ONE PULL. A button on a phone gets tapped twice and retried by
//      the network. Two guards, at different distances: the caller's
//      idempotencyKey (unique index in 077) collapses a literal retry, and an
//      already-open request for the same client is RETURNED rather than
//      duplicated. Neither is decorative — pulling a consumer's credit twice
//      because a request timed out is a real harm and a real cost.
//      Both guards are backed by a unique index and the INSERT carries ON
//      CONFLICT DO NOTHING, because reading and then writing leaves a gap two
//      simultaneous taps both fit through — which they did, three times over,
//      against a real Postgres. See GUARD 3 and 090.
//
//   3. ONE READER OF A PULL PAYLOAD. fulfil() calls ingestCrsResult() from
//      src/tradelines/store.mjs. It does not parse crs_results.result itself and
//      must never start: two readers of one payload that drift apart is the
//      defect class this repo keeps finding, and the normalizer already handles
//      the vendor disagreements (src/tradelines/index.mjs).
//
//   4. NULL SURVIVES. An unknown cost stays NULL all the way down. It is not
//      defaulted to zero on the way in, and it is not rendered as "$0.00" on the
//      way out — see costDisplay().
//
//
// NO SUBSCRIPTION IMPORT, DELIBERATELY. subscriptionId is a plain parameter and
// this module imports nothing from the subscription/stored-card build. That work
// runs in parallel; coupling the two through an import would make each unable to
// land without the other. NULL is a legitimate value here and means "ad-hoc, or
// the plan is unknown", never "free".

/* withTransaction — a REAL transaction, which took catching to get right.
 *
 * The idiom in src/pii/index.mjs is `if (typeof db.connect !== "function")
 * return fn(db)` — "a pool gets a transaction, a test double is used as-is".
 * That probe is wrong against this repo's own database handle: `src/db.mjs`
 * exports `db` as `{ query }` and NOTHING ELSE. It has no connect(), so the
 * probe takes the no-transaction branch and the callback runs with autocommit,
 * on the one object every production caller actually passes.
 *
 * Caught by a test, not by reading: "a pull naming an already-resolved request
 * stores NOTHING" failed with an orphan `crs_results` row — the INSERT had
 * committed itself before the fulfil raised. Without the fix, recordPull()
 * would leave the pull history claiming a pull that the ledger says never
 * completed, which is precisely the disagreement this module exists to prevent.
 *
 * So: use the handle's own connect() when it has one (a real Pool, or a test
 * double that wants to observe BEGIN/COMMIT), reach for the pool when we were
 * handed the shared singleton, and only then fall back to running inline for a
 * plain fake in a unit test.
 *
 * NOTE FOR WHOEVER OWNS src/pii/index.mjs: revealSsn() has this same probe and
 * the same handle, so its rule 3 — "the access log is written in the same
 * transaction as the reveal; if the log write fails, the reveal fails" — does
 * not hold as shipped. I did not change it here; it is a behavioural change to
 * a compliance path and deserves its own review. Written up as a finding.
 *
 * EXPORTED (100_retention_policy). scripts/retention-purge.mjs needs a real
 * transaction and this is the only correct one in the tree — the version in
 * src/pii/index.mjs is the broken probe described above. Exporting the working
 * one beats copying it: two transaction helpers that drift apart is precisely
 * the bug CLAUDE.md §8 "reuse before you build" is about. Nothing else changed.
