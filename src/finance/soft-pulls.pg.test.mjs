// Postgres-backed tests for the soft-pull ledger.
//
// TWO CLAIMS, AND NEITHER CAN BE PROVEN WITHOUT A REAL DATABASE:
//
//   1. AN UNATTRIBUTED PULL IS REFUSED BY THE TABLE, not only by the module.
//      soft-pulls.test.mjs proves requestSoftPull() refuses before it queries.
//      That is a promise about one function. This file proves the promise holds
//      against a writer that does not go through it — a script, a psql session,
//      a future module that forgot — because the CHECK constraint in 077 is what
//      actually adjudicates it. A rule enforced only by the code that usually
//      writes is a convention, not a control.
//
//   2. A RESULT LANDS THROUGH THE EXISTING INGEST PATH. fulfilSoftPull() calls
//      ingestCrsResult() from src/tradelines/store.mjs, and the assertion is
//      against the `tradelines` rows that appear — not against a return value.
//      A return value is the function's account of what it did; the rows are
//      what it did. The unit test can only check that a matching SQL string was
//      issued; only Postgres can say the cards are actually there, with the
//      limits and APRs the normalizer produced.
//
// Skipped without DATABASE_URL, like every other *.pg.test.mjs. See the trap in
// CLAUDE.md §12: with DATABASE_URL unset these skip and the suite reports zero
// failures, so a green `npm test` is not evidence any of this ran.

       one question, two consumer-credit events and two charges.

       EACH CALLER GETS ITS OWN, ALREADY-OPEN CONNECTION (withClients below).
       Handing all three the shared pool handle does NOT reproduce this: the
       first caller has a warm connection and finishes both of its statements
       while the others are still completing a TCP connect and password
       handshake, so they never actually overlap and the test passes on a broken
       guard. A phone retrying a tap against a warm serverless pool has no such
       head start. Asserting on the ROWS, not on the return values: the return
       value is the module's account of what it did, and the row is what an

    /* THE RETRY KEY IS THE OTHER HALF OF RULE 2, AND IT IS THE HALF THE
       DATABASE ADJUDICATES ON ITS OWN INDEX.

       uq_soft_pull_requests_idem (077) is keyed (org_id, idempotency_key) —
       the CLIENT is not in it. The test above races two taps that share a key
       AND a client, so Postgres may settle it on either index and the retry
       key's own behaviour is never isolated. These two do isolate it: same org,
       same key, DIFFERENT clients, so uq_soft_pull_requests_idem is the only
       index that can fire.

       What must never happen, in either order:

         * a caller asking about client Y is handed client X's request row.
           That row says who asked for X's credit to be pulled, why, and what it
           cost — another consumer's credit-pull record, returned to somebody who
           asked about a different person.
         * Y's request is silently dropped while the caller is told `ok`. The
           screen then shows a pull in flight that no ledger row records.
         * a raw Postgres unique violation (SQLSTATE 23505) escapes. The route
           (api/finance/soft-pull.mjs) only converts SoftPullError and
           CLIENT_DATA_ERRORS, so anything else reaches netlify/functions/api.mjs
           and becomes a 500 on somebody's phone.

       A refusal is a correct answer here. Handing back the wrong person's row
       is not. */
