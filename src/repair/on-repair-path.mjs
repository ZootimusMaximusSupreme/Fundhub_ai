// Is this client on the REPAIR path? One answer, one place.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The owner's standing rule is that repair work only happens for
// clients on the repair offer path. Until 2026-09-03 that rule was enforced in
// the letter engine and nowhere near the screen: the client portal showed the
// "Sign to authorize dispute letters" card to EVERY client, and
// api/consent/capture.mjs recorded the signature for anybody who sent one. Walk
// finding F35 caught it on an Academy buyer — somebody who bought a course being
// asked to authorize credit disputes.
//
// TWO SIGNALS, AND BOTH ARE ALREADY LOAD-BEARING SOMEWHERE ELSE. Neither is
// invented here; this file only puts them behind one name so a screen and an
// endpoint cannot disagree about who counts as a repair client.
//
//   1. The `metro2-letter-pack` entitlement — granted on a repair purchase
//      (src/repair/enroll.mjs) and already the repair lane in
//      src/repair/upload-doors.mjs.
//   2. outcome_tier REPAIR_ONLY — the tier the DIY letter workflow refuses
//      without (src/workflows/ds-02-diy-letters.mjs:143).
//
// EITHER, NOT BOTH. A repair buyer has the entitlement before any pull has run,
// and a REPAIR_ONLY client on the DIY path has the tier before they have bought
// anything. Requiring both would shut the door on each of them in turn.
//
// FAILS CLOSED. No org, no client, or a database that will not answer → false.
// The cost of a false negative is a repair client who has to be sent the sign
// link by hand. The cost of a false positive is a course buyer being asked to
// authorize credit disputes, which is the thing this closes.
