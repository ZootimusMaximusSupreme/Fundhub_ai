// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE DOUBLE-MAILING GUARD
//
// Before this, the loop below set status='sent' with no check of the current
// status, and dispute_letters carried no unique index. So re-POSTing the same
// payload handed the same letters to PostGrid again: two identical letters in a
// real person's post, two at the bureau, and two bills. A disabled button in a
// browser is not a guard — a retry, a second tab or curl walks past it.
//
// db/migrations/332 added the database half and got one thing badly wrong: it
// made the claim and the mailing the same fact, stamping `mailed_at` BEFORE the
// provider was called. So the unique index counted ATTEMPTS, and an attempt
// that died above the network burned the only mailing slot the letter would
// ever have. db/migrations/333 splits them:
//
//   send_claimed_at — this row is TAKEN. Stamped before the call. Releasable.
//   mailed_at       — this row WAS MAILED. Stamped only after the provider
//                     answered with an id. Never released, by anyone.
//
// and keys one partial unique index on each, over
// (org_id, case_id, bureau, round, target):
//
//   uq_dispute_letters_one_mailing     WHERE mailed_at IS NOT NULL
//     One physical mailing per case, bureau, round and destination, for ever.
//     Nothing below can release a row from it.
//   uq_dispute_letters_one_send_claim  WHERE send_claimed_at IS NOT NULL
//     A superset (a mailed row keeps its claim), so a regenerated replacement
//     for an already-mailed letter is refused at CLAIM time — before the call,
//     rather than by a unique violation after the envelope is in the post.
//     This one releases.
//
// This is the code half. A letter is CLAIMED before the provider is called, in
// one statement, so two callers cannot both pass the check: the second one's
// UPDATE matches nothing and it never makes the call.
//
// REFUSE ONLY ON POSITIVE EVIDENCE. A claim that affects no rows is not by
// itself proof of a double send — the letter id might name no row at all, which
// is a bad request and is exactly as (un)guarded as it was before this change.
// So a failed claim is followed by a read, and the send is refused only when
// that read shows a row that really is already claimed or already sent, or when
// the unique index rejected the claim because a DIFFERENT row for the same
// case, bureau, round and destination has already gone out.

const UNIQUE_VIOLATION = "23505";

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// DID ANYTHING ACTUALLY GO OUT? — THE FACT FIRST, THE STRINGS ONLY AS FALLBACK
//
// This decision is the whole guard. Get it wrong one way and a real person gets
// two identical dispute letters and we get two bills. Get it wrong the other
// way and a send that never happened permanently destroys the letter, and the
// replacement, and every replacement after that.
//
// IT WAS WRONG THE SECOND WAY, and it was wrong because it read prose. The list
// below was the only test, so a refusal whose wording was not on it kept the
// claim. Measured on a real database on 2026-09-05 with a fetch implementation
// that throws if it is ever reached — it never fired, so nothing was
// transmitted, and the letter still died:
//
//   press 1  outbound fence held the call   -> row: sending | mailed_at STAMPED
//   press 2  same letter, fence off         -> "already_mailed",  mailer called 0
//   press 3  a brand new replacement row    -> "already_mailed_duplicate_letter"
//
// The caller had already been handed the answer. src/lib/outbound-fetch.mjs
// returns `transmitted: false` from every branch that sits above the fetch
// call, and src/messaging/providers/mail-letter.mjs now carries that up as
// `preTransmission`. So the order is:
//
//   1. If the mailer stated a fact, believe the fact — either way. An explicit
//      preTransmission:false overrides the strings, because "we made the call"
//      is knowledge and a matching prefix is a coincidence.
//   2. Only if it said nothing, fall back to the strings.
//
// BOTH EXIST ON PURPOSE. Not every caller passes the flag through: the mailSender
// closure in api/repair/send.mjs rebuilds the result as
// `{ ok, outcome, error }` and drops everything else, and mailBureauLetter's own
// address refusals (src/metro2/delivery/send.mjs) are plain objects with no flag
// at all. Those are all genuinely pre-transmission and the list is what still
// catches them. Delete the list and they start keeping claims they should
// release; trust the list alone and you are back to the bug above.
//
// Anything not proven pre-transmission KEEPS THE CLAIM. If a call was made and
// did not come back we do not know whether the letter went, and retrying is the
// one action that can actually mail it twice. Same call subscription_charges
// makes for 'in_flight' (db/migrations/276). The difference from before is that
// a kept claim is no longer a dead end: clearStuckSendClaim() below gives a
// human a way out, on the record.

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE WAY OUT OF A STUCK CLAIM
//
// A letter whose provider call went out and never came back keeps its claim, on
// purpose: nobody can say whether it was mailed, and a retry is the one action
// that can put a second envelope in a real person's post.
//
// Before this, that was the end of the story. Nothing in the repository could
// clear the row. The PostGrid webhook keys on postgrid_letter_id, which is NULL
// on a stuck row, so it never fires. The re-stage path skipped 'sending', so it
// wrote a fresh row that the unique index then refused as well. "A human
// reconciles it" named no human and no action.
//
// So: a staff member reconciles the letter against the provider's own record,
// decides it did not go, and says so here — with their id and their reason,
// both stored on the row and written to repair_decision_log where
// src/repair/lens.mjs renders it in plain words on the client's timeline.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO.
//   It clears send_claimed_at. It NEVER touches mailed_at, and it refuses
//   outright on any row that carries one, or a provider id. So it cannot turn a
//   letter that really went out into one that may go out again — that invariant
//   lives in uq_dispute_letters_one_mailing and nothing here can release a row
//   from it.
//
//   It CAN be wrong in the other direction. If the letter did reach PostGrid and
//   the reply was simply lost, clearing lets it be sent a second time. That risk
//   is real, it is why this is deliberate and attributed rather than automatic,
//   and it is why nothing calls this on a timer.

/** How long a claim must have sat before a human may call it stuck. Short
    enough to be usable inside one support conversation, long enough that it
    cannot race a provider call that is simply slow — the transport's own hard
    timeout is 10s (src/lib/outbound-fetch.mjs DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS). */
