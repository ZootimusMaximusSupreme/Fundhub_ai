/* Match lenders to a client's underwrite profile.
   Structural rules only — no invented approval criteria or lender names.

   Filters:
   1. active lenders only (unless includeInactive)
   2. eligible_states — the client has TWO states, home and business, and a
      lender is eligible when it covers EITHER (case-insensitive token match).
      Empty lender eligible_states = unknown → include (do not invent a
      restriction). No known client state = unknown → include.
   3. inquiry sensitivity — skip lenders whose bureaus_pulled intersect
      sensitive bureaus (open/recent inquiries on that bureau).
   4. the credit file — skip a lender whose own stated minimum score is above
      this file's score. See "THE CREDIT FILE" below for why this reads almost
      nothing today.
   5. bureau rotation — rank by how little the planned set already leans on
      each lender's expected bureau(s).

   6. no business on file, no business credit cards (owner rule 2026-09-06).

   Returns { matches, skipped, summary } — never fabricates lenders. */

/* ─────────────────── TWO STATES, TWO LANES OF LENDERS ───────────────────
   Owner rule, 2026-09-04: eligibility runs off the client's HOME state AND
   their BUSINESS state, not one of them. "If they live in Arizona but they
   also have a business in Florida, that opens up two lanes of opportunity to
   national banks and then local banks that only do business in those two
   states."

   The defect this replaces: resolveMatchState() returned a single value, and
   returned it the moment it found a business state, so the home state was a
   fallback that never ran once a business existed. An Arizona client with a
   Florida business was matched as Florida only, and every Arizona-only local
   bank was dropped — silently, because a lender the state gate never reached
   is not in `skipped` either.

   Unknown stays unknown. A state we do not hold is not a block and never
   becomes one: an empty state set means every lender clears the state gate,
   exactly as an empty single state did before. */

/* ─────────────────────────── THE CREDIT FILE ───────────────────────────
   Funding finding 7, 2026-09-03: this matcher read state, bureau sensitivity
   and the active flag and nothing else, so a 588 repair file and a 780 funding
   file got the identical list and a lender who only takes 700+ matched both.

   MEASURED BEFORE BUILDING, against the load path
   (credentials/lenders-audit/lenders-audited.csv, 313 rows, the CSV import
   that fills this table):

     * there is no minimum-credit-score column on `lenders` at all — see
       db/migrations/138_lenders.sql. The nearest columns,
       minimum_time_in_business_years and minimum_revenue_threshold, are real
       and numeric but are 0/313 filled, and are business facts, not credit;
     * `stated_requirements` is filled on 75 of 313 rows and mentions checking
       accounts, seasoning and business age. Searching EVERY column of all 313
       rows for "fico", "credit score", "score" or an "NNN+" figure returns
       0 rows.

   So no lender in this table states a credit minimum, and this gate therefore
   excludes nobody today. That is the correct outcome and not a bug to route
   around: a guessed credit floor would silently hide real lenders from a real
   client. The pathway below is what the data drops into when it exists —
   either a numeric `minimum_credit_score` column (a migration nobody has
   written) or readable words in `stated_requirements`.

   Reading rule, both directions: a lender we cannot read is a lender we may
   not exclude. Unparseable requirement text keeps the lender and is counted
   as unreadable in the summary, never turned into a number. */
