// The nudge runner — plan, then re-decide, then claim, then queue.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7). Client-facing messaging on a
// consumer-finance file.
//
// THIS FILE DOES NOT SEND. It writes a `messages` row with status='queued' via
// sendTemplated (src/workflows/messaging.mjs) and stops there. The dispatcher
// (src/messaging/dispatch.mjs, swept every five minutes) is the only thing that
// hands a row to a provider, and outbound transmission itself is permitted only
// inside src/messaging/providers/ — CLAUDE.md §12. There is no fetch in this
// module, no provider import, and no path around either.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FOUR PHASES, AND WHY THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
//
//   1. PLAN     find overdue, client-owned waypoints whose next rung is due.
//   2. RE-DECIDE run every exit condition again, against the live row.
//   3. CLAIM    write the waypoint_nudges row FIRST, before anything is queued.
//   4. QUEUE    only now call sendTemplated, and record what came back.
//
// Phase 2 exists because of the exact wording of exit condition 1: check
// completion AT SEND TIME, not only at schedule time. A waypoint the client
// finishes in the seconds between the plan and the send must produce nothing.
// Splitting plan from deliver is what makes that provable rather than asserted
// — the test drives planNudges(), completes the waypoint, then drives
// deliverNudge() on the stale plan and watches zero rows appear.
//
// Phase 3 is before phase 4 for the reason the 2026-09-03 incident exists. That
// loop decided, then sent, then recorded — so sixteen duplicate webhooks each
// decided before any of them had recorded, and sixteen texts went out. Here the
// record IS the decision: whoever wins the insert owns the step and everyone
// else gets zero rows back from ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and stops. There is no
// window between deciding and recording, because they are one statement.
//
// The cost of that ordering is honest and worth stating: if this process dies
// between the claim and the queue, the row sits at outcome='claimed' and that
// rung is spent without a message going out. It is NOT retried. A missed nudge
// is a stalled checklist item the client can see on their own page and a staff
// task at step 4; a retried nudge is the 51 texts. The trade only goes one way.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE THREE CAPS, AND WHO ENFORCES THEM
//
// None of them is enforced here. All three are unique constraints in the
// database, and this file only reads the result:
//
//   FOUR MESSAGES PER WAYPOINT, EVER — UNIQUE (waypoint_id, step) with
//   CHECK (step BETWEEN 1 AND 4), db/migrations/365. A fifth row is unwritable.
//
//   ONE CLIENT-FACING MESSAGE PER CLIENT PER DAY, ACROSS EVERY WAYPOINT —
//   the partial UNIQUE (client_id, client_local_date), 365. Three overdue items
//   produce one text because the second and third inserts conflict, not
//   because a counter in JavaScript said so. A SELECT-then-INSERT here would
//   be the same check-then-write race `transactions` already has.
//
//   ONE CLIENT-FACING MESSAGE PER DESTINATION PER DAY —
//   the partial UNIQUE (org_id, destination_key, client_local_date),
//   db/migrations/369. The cap above counts RECORDS, and a person with two
//   client rows on the same phone is two records, so they got two texts in a
//   day. This one counts the phone number the text actually reaches. Both are
//   in force; the effective rule is the stricter of the two.
//
// ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING absorbs whichever one bites, which is why the caller
// has to ask afterwards which it was (whyClaimFailed).

    THE OLD JUSTIFICATION HERE WAS FALSE AND IT COST THE WHOLE FEATURE. It read
    "nothing is lost by stopping early — an unchased waypoint is still overdue
    on the next pass". That is true of a row that can still be chased. It is not
    true of a row that can NEVER be chased again: that row stays overdue for

      1. PERMANENT_STOPS_SQL — every permanent refusal is applied INSIDE the

         two missed: round two only anti-joined the currently-due rung against
         waypoint_nudges, which catches a waypoint that has already been written
         to and misses every waypoint that never writes a row at all. A client
         who is opted out, escalated, cancelled, complete or has already replied
         is refused by blockersFor AFTER the LIMIT and deliverNudge writes
         nothing, so there is no row to anti-join against. Opt-out is the most
         common permanent stop in any messaging product; measured on a scratch
         Postgres on 2026-09-06, 200 opted-out clients starved a live one to
         zero messages on every pass.
      2. The rung anti-join from round two, kept.

   PERMANENT STOPS, APPLIED BEFORE THE LIMIT — THE ROUND-THREE FIX
   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   THE DEFECT. blockersFor() is the gate, and it runs in JavaScript in
   deliverNudge — which is AFTER the LIMIT has already chosen which 200 rows
   this pass will look at. When it refuses, deliverNudge returns "skipped" and
   writes NOTHING. So the waypoint stays not_started, stays overdue, stays the
   oldest, sorts FIRST on the next pass, and holds a slot for ever. The sweeper
   calls runNudges with orgId = null, so those 200 slots are ONE BUDGET FOR THE
   WHOLE PLATFORM.

   Measured on a scratch Postgres 16.14 on 2026-09-06, in this worktree:

     200 clients whose programs are CANCELLED, plus one freshly overdue client
       pass 1: candidates 200, live included? false, queued 0, budget_exhausted
       true, messages to the live client 0 — and the same on the next day.

     200 clients who had texted STOP, plus one freshly overdue client
       identical: 200 candidates, live included? false, 0 messages, for ever.

   Round two added an anti-join on (waypoint_id, step) and a `budget_exhausted`
   warning. Neither touches this: the row never writes a waypoint_nudges row at
   all, so there is nothing to anti-join against, and making a silent failure
   loud is not making it stop.

   THE RULE. A WAYPOINT THAT CAN NO LONGER BE CHASED MUST NOT HOLD A SLOT.

   WHICH STOPS ARE PERMANENT AND WHICH ARE NOT. Every branch of blockersFor()
   is classified below. "Permanent" here means: while it is true, no amount of
   waiting makes this waypoint sendable, so leaving it in the queue can only
   starve somebody else. It does NOT mean irreversible — every clause is
   re-evaluated from scratch on every pass, so a client who opts back in, or a
   'blocked' row a member of staff unblocks, is a candidate again on the very
   next pass. Nothing here is a tombstone.

     PERMANENT — excluded below, before the LIMIT
       waypoint_missing         the row is gone; it cannot be selected at all
       owner_is_fundhub         owner_kind <> 'client'

                                four): a refund means the money went back, which
                                means we did NOT do it for them, and treating it
                                as a purchase bought their permanent silence

                                db/migrations/370).

                                THIS ONE WAS MISCLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARY AND IT
                                WAS THE ROUND-FOUR BLOCKER. The stated reason
                                was "a checkout link is out. It expires; then we
                                chase again." Nothing in this codebase ever
                                expired one — no expiry column existed, nothing
                                at mint set a deadline, and no file under
                                src/workflows/ so much as named the table. So
                                the hold was permanent while being filed as
                                temporary, and it held a slot for ever.
                                Reproduced here: 200 clients each holding an
                                awaiting_payment request minted 400 days ago,
                                plus one freshly overdue live client — 200
                                candidates, the live one not among them, zero
                                messages to them, that day and a year later.

                                Now it is excluded WHILE THE LINK IS LIVE, which
                                costs nothing (the gate would have refused it a
                                moment later anyway, so the slot was being spent
                                on a guaranteed refusal) and it comes straight
                                back into the queue the moment the stamp passes.
                                An expired one is chased again, exactly as the
                                original sentence promised.

     TEMPORARY — deliberately NOT excluded; these keep their place in the queue
       not_overdue              tomorrow it is due. It is the query's own
                                due_at filter, so it is not a candidate today
                                and holds no slot either way.
       check_failed             a database error. Transient by definition, and
                                excluding on "we could not tell" would turn one
                                bad query into a permanent silence.
       one-per-day / per-destination caps, and quiet hours — all in
                                deliverNudge, all true only for today, all of
                                them must still be reached tomorrow. The daily
                                cap no longer BURNS the budget, though: see
                                ONE WAYPOINT PER CLIENT PER PASS below.

   THIS IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GATE. Every clause below mirrors a branch of
   blockersFor() exactly, so a row it removes is a row the gate would have
   refused. deliverNudge still runs the whole gate against the live row before
   anything is written — see the "stale plan" proof in ./run.pg.test.mjs — and
   the test named "every waypoint the SQL removes is one the gate would have
   refused" in that file fails if these two ever disagree.

   ONE HONEST GAP. `escalation` is excluded by the presence of a
   client_escalations row, and that row is written by the detector the first
   time it runs for that client. A client who has threatened us but has never
   been scanned therefore still holds a slot for exactly one pass — the pass
   that scans them, refuses them, and writes the row. From the next pass on they
   are gone from the queue. Nothing is sent to them on that pass; the gate
   refuses it. */

/* ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ONE WAYPOINT PER CLIENT PER PASS — THE DAILY CAP STOPS BURNING THE BUDGET
   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   THE DEFECT. The database allows ONE client-facing message per client per
   calendar day, across all of their waypoints (365's partial unique index). The
   pass did not know that: it took the 200 oldest due rows, and a client with
   eight overdue items contributed all eight. The first became their message and
   the other seven were refused as `daily_cap` — having each spent a slot. Being
   the oldest rows, they sorted first, so they did it again on the next hourly
   pass, and the one after.

   Measured by a reviewer, reproduced here on a scratch Postgres 16.14 on
   2026-09-06 — 25 clients with 8 overdue rows each, plus one live client:

     day 0: candidates 200, queued 25, 175 refused for daily_cap, the live
            client NOT in the plan, 0 messages to them
     day 1: identical. The live client waited two days.

   Effective throughput was 25 clients a day out of a budget of 200.

   THE FIX. DISTINCT ON (client_id), ordered oldest-first, so each client
   contributes exactly ONE candidate to a pass: their most overdue item. Nothing
   is lost — the other seven could not have produced a message today under the
   cap the database already enforces, and they are still there tomorrow. The
   rows they were displacing belong to clients who CAN be messaged.

   IT IS NOT A SECOND CAP. The cap is still 365's unique index and deliverNudge
   still discovers it the same way; this only stops the pass from spending its
   budget discovering it 175 times. */
