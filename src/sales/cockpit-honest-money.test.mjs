// THE NUMBERS ON THE CALL SCREEN ARE SOURCED, OR THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
//
// Every one of these was live on public/app/closer-dashboard.html on
// 2026-08-30, and each one is the same mistake wearing different clothes: a
// screen stating something it does not know.
//
//   1. THE SUCCESS FEE WAS A CONSTANT. cockpit.mjs set success_fee_percent to
//      0.10 flat, so the screen printed "10%" whatever the file said, on a row
//      labelled "Success fee" as if it were this round's agreed number.
//      funding_closeout.fee_percent is the real column and had NO reader on any
//      staff screen. The fee the work earned was invisible to the person who
//      earned it.
//
//   2. THE TIME OF THE CALL WAS AN INFERENCE. The payload carried no field
//      meaning "the time of THIS call", so the screen took the head of
//      up_next[] and hoped. On a deep link to a client with no booked task that
//      is somebody else's appointment, printed beside this client's name.
//
//   3. ZERO STOOD IN FOR UNKNOWN. Two of the three funding bands read
//      totals.total_personal_funding / total_combined_funding, and the engine
//      returns those as the NUMBER 0 — never null — when it has nothing to work
//      with. A client with no credit pull showed "Realistic $0". A closer reads
//      that as "this person can get nothing". It means "nobody has pulled their
//      credit." CLAUDE.md §12: NULL means unknown and must survive.
//
//   4. THE BROWSER PICKED WHICH MONEY THE CALL EARNED. closer-call.js posted a
//      transaction_id it had read from a payment query with NO TIME BOUND, and
//      call-outcomes.mjs trusts an explicit id over its own 48-hour window. A
//      repeat client who paid $500 four months ago and closed for $1,000 today
//      had the four-month-old payment logged as today's cash.
//
// The first three are checked by RUNNING buildCockpit against a stub database,
// not by reading it. The fourth is checked in the browser file, in the same
// style as src/http/closer-ui-honest.test.mjs, because there is no DOM harness
// in this repo and inventing one for four assertions is not the trade.
