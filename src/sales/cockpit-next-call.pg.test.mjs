// THE CLOCK THESE FIXTURES HANG OFF
//
// Every row below is booked at `date_trunc('second', now()) + N hours`, never
// at a named hour of the day, and the whole file runs inside one transaction —
// so `now()` is a single fixed instant (Postgres `now()` is the transaction's
// start time) that both the fixtures and the queries under test read. Call it T.
//
// That is the whole point. The first draft of this file seeded rows at
// `date_trunc('day', now()) + N hours` and then asserted on upcomingCalls(),
// which filters other people's rows by `due_at >= now()`. So the row counts
// moved with the wall clock: 6/6 passed at 00:35, 5/6 at 09:35, 4/6 at 14:35 —
// red for about fifteen hours out of every twenty-four, including the whole of
// CI's UTC working day. A test whose result depends on the hour it runs at is
// not a test. Anchor to T, never to midnight.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT THIS PREVENTS
//
// The call screen prints one line beside the client's name: the time of this
// call, how long until it, and the time of the call after it. The last part was
// picked off the up_next[] array, and up_next cannot answer that question. Its
// ORDER BY is
//
//     ORDER BY CASE WHEN t.client_id = $3 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END, t.due_at ASC
//
// which forces every one of the OPEN client's tasks to the front of the list
// whatever the clock says, and then LIMIT 5 cuts it. Three ordinary days were
// measured against a real Postgres and each one printed something false:
//
//   A) Open client booked T+5h. Somebody else at T+1h.
//      Array order: T+5h, T+1h. The screen named the T+1h as "next" — four
//      hours BEFORE the call it was printed beside.
//
//   B) Open client has T+1h and T+6h. Somebody else at T+2h.
//      Array order: T+1h, T+6h, T+2h. The screen said "next" was T+6h. The
//      closer's real next appointment was never named. That reads as six hours
//      of runway when there is one.
//
//   C) Open client at T+5h, five other calls at T+1h, +2h, +3h, +4h and +6h.
//      LIMIT 5 keeps the open call and the four earlier ones and DROPS the
//      T+6h. Sorting the array by time — the obvious fix — still answers
//      "nothing after this", which is false. C is why this is a query and not
//      a loop: the honest answer is not in that array at any ordering.
//
//   F) Open client's call was at T-5h and was never logged. Somebody else's
//      T-4h was missed and never logged either. The real next call is T+2h.
//      "The first row after T-5h" is the T-4h — a call that finished hours
//      ago. That is the shape the second time bound exists for.
//
// These assertions cannot be made against a stub, because what is being tested
// IS the SQL: an ORDER BY, two time bounds and a LIMIT.
