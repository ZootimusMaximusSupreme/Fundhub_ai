 * 307 lenders, and a closer could repeat that number to a customer on a live

 *
 * So: no credit result, no count and no list. Never a number, never a zero —
 * zero is itself an answer about this client, and there is no answer yet.
 *
 * Funding finding 7 is the other half. matchLenders() now takes the credit
 * file and skips a lender whose own stated minimum score is above it — but no
 * lender in the table states one (0 of 313 rows in the CSV load path say
 * anything about a score), so the credit gate excludes nobody yet. So
 * `lenders_basis` is no longer a fixed sentence: it reports what the matcher
 * actually did to THIS count, and while the requirement data is missing it
 * says so instead of implying a screen that did not happen.

   up_next is not in time order and is not complete. Its ORDER BY forces every
   one of the open client's tasks to the front whatever the clock says, and then
   LIMIT 5 cuts the list. Measured against a real Postgres on 2026-08-31, three
   ordinary days break any answer read off that array:

     A) open client booked 3:00 PM, somebody else at 11:00 AM
        -> array order is 3:00 PM, 11:00 AM, so "next" was 11:00 AM: FOUR HOURS
           BEFORE the call it was printed beside.
     B) open client has 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, somebody else at 11:00 AM
        -> array order is 10:00, 4:00 PM, 11:00, so "next" was 4:00 PM and the
           closer's real next appointment was never named. Six hours of runway
           on the screen, one hour in life.
     C) open client at 3:00 PM with five other calls at 9, 10, 11, 12 and 4:00 PM
        -> LIMIT 5 keeps 3:00 PM, 9, 10, 11, 12 and DROPS the 4:00 PM. Sorting
           the array by time still answers "nothing after this", which is false.

   C is why this is a query and not a loop: the honest answer is not in the array
   at any ordering. One row, ordered by time, no client weighting, no truncation.
   Returns null only when there genuinely is no later call.

   TWO time bounds, not one. `after` alone is not enough: this client's tasks are
   kept from date_trunc('day', now()) onward, so opening a client whose call was
   at 9:00 AM makes `after` a time in the PAST, and "the first row after 9:00 AM"
   can be a 10:00 AM that came and went and was never dispositioned. up_next has
   dropped that 10:00 AM already (it filters everybody else by due_at >= now()),
   so the headline named a finished call while the rail beside it named the real
   one. Both halves of the screen answer from the same clock or neither does. */
