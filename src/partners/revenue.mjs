// @ts-check
// Partner revenue — the accrual writer. W1-money-model.md §7, finding F1.
//
// WHAT THIS FIXES. Until this file existed, nothing in production ever wrote a
// partner_revenue row. The only rows on record came from a test fixture in
// scope.pg.test.mjs, so a white-label partner's half was hand arithmetic on a
// spreadsheet. The schema to do it properly has been in place since
// db/migrations/042_partners.sql; this is the missing wire, and nothing else.
//
// THE FIVE RULES, and where each one is actually enforced.
//
// 1. THE PARTNER'S HALF IS HALF OF CASH THAT ARRIVED, never half of the sticker
//    price. Some of what fundhub sells is financed, and a weak-credit lender
//    remits as little as 30% of the contract. Half of sticker on a 30% remittance
//    pays the partner more money than the deal brought in — fundhub goes negative
//    on a sale that looked profitable. So the base is one sale_payments row's
//    settled `amount`, never sales.agreed_price. One payment row in, one accrual
//    row out. (W1 §1.)
//
// 2. THE RATE IS FROZEN ON THE ROW. share_pct_applied is copied off the partner
//    at the instant of accrual and never revisited. Moving a partner from 50 to
//    20 changes what LATER accruals compute and touches nothing already written,
//    which is the entire reason 042 has that column. No percentage for the
//    partner share is written in this file — it is read from partners.
//
// 3. E-PRODUCTS ARE EXCLUDED BY AN ALLOW-LIST, NOT A DENY-LIST. Courses and
//    digital products stay 100% fundhub (W0-decisions.md). A deny-list means the
//    next course somebody adds quietly starts paying out 50%; an allow-list means
//    it defaults to excluded and somebody has to opt it in on purpose.
//
// 4. IDEMPOTENCY IS THE DATABASE'S JOB. 042 carries two partial unique indexes,
//    on (org_id, source_event_id, partner_id) and (org_id, transaction_id,
//    partner_id). Both columns are set whenever both are known and the INSERT
//    carries a bare ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, which in Postgres covers every unique
//    index on the table. A replayed event and a re-run backfill both land on the
//    same row. Zero rows affected is a SUCCESSFUL no-op, not an error.
//
// 5. REVERSAL IS A VOID WITH A REASON. partner_revenue has a trigger that raises
//    on DELETE and CHECKs that forbid a negative amount, so a refund cannot be
//    expressed as a negative row and money already earned cannot be made to
//    disappear. NO CLAWBACK: owner-set, a reversal after payout is fundhub's
//    loss, recorded and not recovered from the partner.
//
// WHY resolveClient() IS NOT CALLED HERE. It is the right function for turning a
// bus event into a client, and the money chain already calls it upstream — but it
// CREATES a client row when it cannot find one. An accrual writer must never
// mint a client. By the time a sale_payments row exists the client is already
// resolved and pinned on sales.client_id, which is NOT NULL, so the sale row is
// both the cheaper and the safer source of truth.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED: fee/commission timing and payout basis.
