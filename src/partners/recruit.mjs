// @ts-check
// The recruit bonus — who brought whom, and when the $2,000 becomes real.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7): fee timing and payout basis.
//
// WHAT WAS BROKEN. src/partners/revenue.mjs has held accrueRecruitBonus() —
// correct, tested, idempotent — since it was written, and it has never fired
// once. It takes `recruiterPartnerId` and nothing in the system could answer
// that question: no column recorded that partner A brought partner B. This
// module is the two missing halves: the record (backed by
// db/migrations/281_partner_recruited_by.sql) and the trigger.
//
// THE RULE, LOCKED (W0-decisions.md, W1-money-model.md D7):
//   A partner who recruits another partner earns $2,000. Once. On the $10,000
//   entry fee. Nothing ongoing, nothing on the recruit's production.
//
// THE SHARP EDGE, AND WHY IT IS DELIBERATE. The entry fee is usually financed,
// and the lender remits a band-dependent slice of the sticker — as little as 30%.
// The bonus is a FLAT $2,000 against the STICKER, not a percentage of what
// arrived. So at the worst band FundHub receives $3,000 and pays out $2,000,
// netting $1,000. That is positive at every band on the D5 table and negative at
// none, and computeEntryEconomics() below is the arithmetic, proved band by band
// in recruit.test.mjs. The remittance varies; the promise does not.
//
// TIMING IS THE WHOLE POINT. The bonus accrues WHEN THE CASH LANDS — not when the
// application is submitted, not when the partner signs, not when the lender
// approves. That single rule is what keeps the edge above survivable: a partner
// who never funds costs FundHub nothing, because nothing accrued. Cash paid in
// full and cash financed take the same path, because both end in money arriving.
//
// NO CLAWBACK (owner-set). If the entry is refunded or charged back after the
// recruiter has been paid, that is FundHub's loss. It is recorded — the accrual
// is voided by the existing reversal path in src/handlers/money-chain.mjs — and
// it is never recovered from the recruiter. Nothing in this file chases anybody.
//
// MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS via src/commissions/money.mjs. Nothing here formats.
