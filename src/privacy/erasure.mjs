// Client erasure — de-identify a person on an explicit request, and leave behind
// a record that can answer "what did you remove, what do you still hold, and why".
//
// ============================================================================
// 1. THIS NEVER RUNS BY ITSELF. NOT EVER.
// ============================================================================
//
// There is no scheduler here, no retention sweep, no TTL, no "clean up clients
// older than N" job, and none may be added. eraseClient() is called from one
// place — an authenticated endpoint, by a named human, with a written reason —
// and it writes an audit row before it touches anything.
//
// The reason this rule is absolute rather than cautious: automatic erasure of a
// consumer-finance record is indistinguishable, after the fact, from data loss.
// Nobody asked, nobody signed it, and the evidence that it was deliberate is the
// same evidence that would be missing if it were a bug.
//
// ============================================================================
// 2. DE-IDENTIFY, DO NOT DELETE. TWO REASONS, BOTH LOAD-BEARING.
// ============================================================================
//
// (a) THE DATABASE WOULD REFUSE ANYWAY. pii_access_log.client_id references
//     clients(id) with NO cascade (001_init). A hard DELETE of a client with any
//     access-log history is rejected by Postgres. Building an erasure around a
//     delete would mean it works in testing, where nobody read the SSN, and
//     fails in production, where somebody did.
//
// (b) A HARD DELETE IS THE ORPHAN BUG. Deleting the clients row nulls
//     bank_transactions.client_id and cascades bank_accounts away, leaving
//     financial history that nothing can find — exactly what migration 101
//     exists to prevent. An erasure implemented as a delete would MANUFACTURE
//     unfindable personal data while reporting success. That is the worst
//     available outcome: not erased, not auditable, and recorded as done.
//
// So: the identifying values are removed, the row and its uuid stay. The uuid
// stops being an identifier and becomes a pseudonym — it no longer resolves to a
// name, an email, a phone number, an SSN or a date of birth, because none of
// those are there any more. That is what de-identification is, and it is the only
// form of erasure that leaves an auditable trail of itself.
//
// ============================================================================
// 3. WHAT IS KEPT, AND WHY IT IS KEPT — THE HARD HALF
// ============================================================================
//
// Recording what was deleted is easy. The question that gets asked later is
// "you say you erased me; what do you still hold?" KEPT_WITH_REASON below is
// that answer, written down, and every entry lands in the audit row.
//
// *** CRS AND THE SOFT-PULL LEDGER ARE NOT TOUCHED BY THIS MODULE. *** Not
// scrubbed, not nulled, not counted as removed. crs_results, tradelines and
// soft_pull_requests are a live, compliant credit path with its own retention
// obligations under FCRA, and taking a de-identification pass through them is a
// change to a working compliance system that needs its own review, its own
// sign-off, and somebody who owns that path. They are declared KEPT with the
// reason stated. Declaring them is the honest move; quietly editing them is not.
//
// ============================================================================
// 4. ORDER OF OPERATIONS, ALL IN ONE TRANSACTION
// ============================================================================
//
//   1. Resolve the client, scoped to the caller's org. Fail closed.
//   2. Count everything, before anything changes.
//   3. Write the audit row with both manifests.
//   4. Remove and scrub.
//
// If any step fails the whole thing rolls back, including the audit row. A
// half-applied erasure is the one outcome that must not be reachable: it looks
// exactly like a completed one and it is not.
