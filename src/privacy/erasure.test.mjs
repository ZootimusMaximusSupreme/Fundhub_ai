// Client erasure — unit tests over a stubbed database.
//
// No DATABASE_URL and no Postgres. The stub has no connect(), so
// src/db/with-transaction.mjs runs the callback inline and these tests exercise
// the real ordering of statements. The parts that genuinely need a database —
// that the CHECK constraints in migration 102 reject a bad audit row, that the
// cascade really fires — are in erasure.pg.test.mjs, which skips unless
// DATABASE_URL is set.
//
// WHAT IS BEING PROVEN, in order of what it would cost to get wrong:
//   1. NOTHING is removed until the audit row is written.
//   2. The person's transactions are found by the ANCHOR, not only by client_id.
//   3. CRS, tradelines and the soft-pull ledger are NOT TOUCHED.
//   4. The client row is de-identified, never deleted.
//   5. Org scope comes from the caller and fails closed.
