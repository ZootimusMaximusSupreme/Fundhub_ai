// The Business Duplication Map (2026-10-02): what the page must be true of.
//
// Three files, run through the REAL tier engine, never a hand-typed number:
//   clean      — the simulator's clean file, no company saved
//   business   — the same clean file, two saved companies, each with an
//                Experian Business report scored by the engine: one with high
//                balances, one with a judgment, late payments, a UCC filing, a
//                flagged name and a flagged NAICS code
//   repair     — the simulator's damaged file (REPAIR_ONLY) with one company
// Every dollar the page prints is checked against what the engine returned for
// that same file. The plan and the age lines are checked against a fixed clock.
//
// THE EXPERIAN BUSINESS REPORTS BELOW ARE TEST DATA. No real Experian Business
// report is in this repository (searched src/, scripts/, db/, docs/, vendor/,
// 2026-10-02). experianBusinessReport() carries exactly the fields the vendor
// reader takes (vendor/underwriteiq-full/api/lite/crs/derive-business-signals.js),
// in the shape the credit pull stores (src/finance/crs-pull.mjs businessReports).
