// DOCUMENT 5 — Business Duplication Map (free bonus of the $297 Funding Roadmap).
//
// Built "in reverse order" (owner, 2026-10-02): the /roadmap sales page already
// shows a sample of this document (marketing/landing-pages/slo/slo-01-sales.html,
// the `duplication:` entry of `var P`). This is the real document that sample
// shows. Its SECTIONS and WORDING mirror the sample; its NUMBERS come from the
// client's own file and the UnderwriteIQ engine, never from the sample.
//
// OWNER FACTS (final, 2026-10-02):
//   * The map checks personal + business credit: how fundable the client is off
//     the business.
//   * The business side is the Experian Business check, and only Experian
//     Business: business credit score, blemishes, business balances, the NAICS
//     code, the business name, and the exact fix for each so a lender sees a
//     credible business. No DUNS, no net-30, no vendor accounts.
//   * The plan: set companies up right and open them consistently — one to two
//     aged companies ready every quarter, with good names, NAICS codes,
//     reporting and business credit history. "Nothing too crazy."
//   * Unlimited funding over time is true: five to ten companies, each needs
//     time and revenue.
//
// WHERE EVERY FACT COMES FROM — nothing on this page is typed in:
//   personal decision, funding  → the tier engine run on the stored pull
//                                 (decision_label, preapprovals)
//   median score                 → the CLIENT dict (same engine run)
//   each company's name, state,  → the client's saved `businesses` rows
//     start date, NAICS
//   each company's Experian      → crs_results.result.businessReports[] (the
//     Business check               Experian Business reports the credit pull
//                                  bought, src/finance/crs-pull.mjs), each scored
//                                  by the same tier engine (businessSignals and
//                                  preapprovals.business) in
//                                  src/underwrite/letter-pack.mjs
//   name + NAICS flags           → src/underwrite/company-audit.mjs
//   the age bands                → src/underwrite/business-funding.mjs
//                                  businessAgeMultiplier (0.5 / 1 / 2)
//   the funding order            → src/underwrite/funding-sequence.mjs
//   the company set-up rules     → src/underwrite/company-audit.mjs standing
//                                  rules (website, LinkedIn, shell LLC)
//
// A FACT THAT IS NOT ON THE FILE IS SAID TO BE NOT ON THE FILE. No NAICS code
// saved → "not on the file". No Experian Business report → "not on the file".
// Nothing is filled in to make the page look complete.
//
// PURE. No I/O, no engine call, no clock unless the caller passes none. The
// engine scoring of each company happens in letter-pack.mjs, which hands the
// results in as `scoredReports`.
