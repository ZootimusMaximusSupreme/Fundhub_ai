// src/contracts/notify.mjs — the contract actually going out, and being chased.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT WAS MISSING, AND WHY IT LOOKED LIKE THE CONTRACT FEATURE'S FAULT
//
// Every piece of the outbound path already existed and was tested: the queue
// (`messages`), the compliance gate, the retry and quiet-hours logic, and four
// real providers including Mailgun. The one thing missing was ANYTHING THAT
// CALLED THE DISPATCHER — src/messaging/dispatch.mjs says so in its own header:
// "dispatchDue() runs when something calls it, and today nothing does."
//
// So a staff member pressed Send, got a link, and had to paste it somewhere
// themselves. Which reads as "the contract system cannot send contracts", when
// in fact NOTHING in the platform sent anything.
//
// This module is the caller. It queues one message per signer and then hands
// those messages — and ONLY those messages — to the dispatcher.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY IT DISPATCHES BY ID INSTEAD OF CALLING dispatchDue()
//
// dispatchDue(db, { orgId }) claims every message that is due for the org. That
// is correct for the scheduled sweep and surprising here: pressing "send this
// contract" would also flush whatever else happened to be waiting. Sending a
// contract sends THAT CONTRACT — the rows this module just wrote, claimed by id
// and dispatched one at a time.
//
// IT STILL OBEYS THE SAME PAUSE BUTTON. deliverQueued() reads
// messaging_settings.outbound_enabled (119) and refuses when a company has
// paused its outbound mail. A switch with an exception in it is not a switch,
// and an operator who pauses sending must not find contracts still going out.
// The rows simply stay queued, and the scheduled sweep picks them up when
// sending is turned back on.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// IT DEGRADES, IT NEVER FAILS THE SEND
//
// If no email provider is configured, or the org has no routing row, or the
// gate holds the message — the contract is still sent, the links are still
// minted and shown, and the row stays in the queue with its reason recorded.
// A contract that is legally sent must not be reported as failed because an
// email did not go. Every function here returns an outcome; none of them throw
// into the send path.
//
// NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS DIRECTLY. It writes rows and calls the dispatcher,
// which resolves a provider from `message_channel_routing`. Outbound fetch lives
// in src/messaging/providers/* and nowhere else (CLAUDE.md §12) — that rule is
// untouched, and this module could not break it if it tried: it holds no URL
// and no credential.
