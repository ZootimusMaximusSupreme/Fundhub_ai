// THE PRICE IN THE CATALOGUE AND THE FEE IN THE CONTRACT MUST SAY THE SAME
// THING. This file fails when they stop.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, so the shape of these assertions makes sense.
// src/config/offers.mjs priced REPAIR_DFY at 100000 integer cents — $1,000,
// charged once. The contract wording seeded by
// db/migrations/169_contract_template_placeholders.sql read "You pay
// {{field.monthly_fee}} per month while services are active", and
// defaultContractValues() filled that blank with the SAME $1,000, alongside a
// 180-day term. Every repair client therefore signed for $1,000 a month for six
// months — $6,000 — against a $1,000 product. Nothing failed. Both halves were
// individually correct; only their meeting was wrong, and nothing was looking
// at the meeting. This file is what looks at it.
// db/migrations/273_repair_fee_charged_once.sql is the fix.
//
// FOUR CLASSES OF DRIFT ARE CAUGHT HERE:
//
//   1. The number disagrees. The blank a contract states a fee in no longer
//      carries the catalogue's priceCents.
//   2. The words disagree. The copy describes a repeating charge for a product
//      that is billed once.
//   3. The rename went half way. offers.mjs fills a blank the template does not
//      declare, or the template declares a required blank offers.mjs does not
//      fill — either way a client reads a fee line with nothing in it.
//   4. A new fee blank appears and nobody says what it is. Every money-shaped
//      blank has to be registered below as either a catalogue price or a
//      deliberate non-price.
//
// WHY THIS READS db/*.sql RATHER THAN A DATABASE. The .pg.test.mjs files skip
// without DATABASE_URL, and a guard that skips is not a guard — the same
// reasoning src/subscriptions/partner-subscriptions.test.mjs states. The SQL
// under db/ is what every environment is built from, so it is the honest
// source. It is read in db/migrate.mjs's own order (schema, migrations, seed;
// filenames sorted), and a later file superseding an earlier one is exactly
// what a later definition here does.
