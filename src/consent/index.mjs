// Consent — the gate that stands in front of a consumer-credit event.
//
// *** NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS. ***
// This module reads and writes one table (db/migrations/099_client_consents.sql)
// and asks one question: may we act on this person's credit right now. There is
// no outbound `fetch()` in src/adapters/ or src/lib/ and this does not add one.
//
//
// THE ONE RULE THIS MODULE ENFORCES.
//
// A consent is VALID only if all four are true, at the moment of asking:
//
//   1. it exists, for this client, of this kind, IN THIS ORG;
//   2. it has not been revoked;
//   3. it has not expired;
//   4. it has already started (granted_at is not in the future).
//
// Every one of those is evaluated IN THE SQL, against the database's clock, and
// not in JavaScript against the web server's. That is not a stylistic choice.
// Comparing `new Date()` to a timestamp read out of Postgres puts two clocks in
// a compliance decision, and the one that drifts is the one nobody monitors. A
// consent expiring is a question with exactly one right answer and one clock
// entitled to give it.
//
//
// FAIL CLOSED, EVERYWHERE, AND SPECIFICALLY ON THE ORG.
//
// A missing org does not mean "any org". It means we do not know who is asking,
// and a gate that does not know who is asking must not open. hasValidConsent()
// returns false for a missing or blank orgId rather than dropping the org from
// the WHERE clause — a scoped query with no scope is the bug that turns a
// per-tenant gate into a global one, and it looks like a small tidy-up in a
// diff. The org comes from the SESSION at the call site (staff.org_id, or the
// account principal's orgId); it is never read from a query string or a body.
//
// A missing clientId or an unknown kind is the same answer for the same reason.
// This function has no failure mode that produces `true`.
//
//
// THE NEWEST VALID ONE WINS, AND THERE IS NO UNIQUE INDEX.
//
// 099 deliberately allows many consent rows per (client, kind) — consent
// expires and is renewed, is revoked and later given afresh, and the wording
// changes and is re-consented. Its header explains why a unique index there is
// the same trap 077 documents for its own queued-request index. The rule "the
// current consent is the newest valid one" therefore lives here, in the ORDER
// BY, where it can be read.
