// Shifts — clock-in / clock-out, the writer for a table that has never had one.
//
// `shifts` and `staff_events` have existed since 001_init.sql. Nothing wrote to
// either. This module is the write path behind the clock-in control; the HTTP
// endpoint, the middleware that keeps a shift alive, and the telemetry writer
// that fills `staff_events` for ordinary work all live elsewhere and call in
// here.
//
// THE COLUMNS ARE started_at / ended_at. Not clock_in_at / clock_out_at. Every
// statement below uses the real names; a shift is "open" iff ended_at IS NULL,
// which is also the predicate on both indexes.
//
// *** ONE OPEN SHIFT PER STAFF MEMBER IS A DATABASE FACT, NOT A JAVASCRIPT ONE. ***
// It is enforced by `uq_shifts_one_open` (db/migrations/060_shifts_one_open.sql).
// The pre-existing `idx_shifts_open` was believed to enforce it and does not —
// it is a plain partial index, and the plan that said otherwise was reading the
// name. clockIn() therefore does NOT do a check-then-insert. It inserts, and
// lets the index be the arbiter, because the whole failure mode here is two
// requests racing (double-tapped button, retried timeout, second browser tab)
// and a SELECT-then-INSERT has a window between the two statements that no
// amount of application care can close. What it does instead is translate the
// unique_violation into the 409 the caller deserves, so a race reads as
// "you are already clocked in" rather than a 500.
//
// NOTHING HERE COMPUTES HOURS. No duration column, no daily total, no rounding
// to the nearest quarter hour. Hours are a function of (started_at, ended_at)
// and belong to whatever reads them; storing a second answer would let the two
// disagree, and the one people are paid against must not be the derived copy.
//
// NOTHING HERE EMITS A BUS EVENT. There is no canonical event for a staff
// member starting or ending a shift, and per the repo convention names are not
// added to src/events/canonical.mjs unilaterally. See src/auth/PROPOSED-EVENTS.md,
// which reaches the same conclusion from the auth side and notes specifically
// that a login is NOT a clock-in. The functions below take `db` and write
// tables directly, exactly as src/auth/ does.
