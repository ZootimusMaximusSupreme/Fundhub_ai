// Recurring-bill detection — what does this client actually pay out, every
// month, whether or not they remember it.
//
// *** EVERY FUNCTION IN THIS FILE IS PURE. ***
// No database handle, no fetch, no provider, no clock, no randomness, no
// mutation of its inputs. Rows in, answer out. The same rows and the same `now`
// produce the same answer on any machine on any day, forever — which is the
// only reason any of this can be tested or audited at all.
//
// It does not import anything from the Plaid-link, card-liability or
// projection threads. It takes account ids and transaction rows as PARAMETERS.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 1. THE SIGN CONVENTION. STATED ONCE, HERE, AND ENFORCED BELOW.
// ===========================================================================
//
//   *** NEGATIVE amount_cents = MONEY LEFT THE ACCOUNT (outflow / a bill).
//   *** POSITIVE amount_cents = MONEY ENTERED THE ACCOUNT (inflow / income).
//
// db/migrations/085_bank_transactions.sql section 1 is the authority and says
// the same thing; db/migrations/086_recurring_bills.sql enforces it in the
// database with `CHECK (typical_amount_cents < 0)`.
//
// *** PLAID'S LEGACY /transactions/get CONVENTION IS THE OPPOSITE *** — it
// reports a purchase as a POSITIVE number. Ingest must negate at that boundary.
// This module does NOT try to be clever about it. It does not take absolute
// values and it does not guess which way round a batch is: a positive row is
// an inflow, full stop, and it is EXCLUDED from bill detection with the named
// reason `inflow_not_an_outflow`.
//
// That refusal is the enforcement. Getting the sign backwards is the most
// expensive available mistake here because it does not fail — it silently
// inverts every downstream cash-flow number and turns a client's salary into
// their largest monthly bill. If a whole batch arrives un-negated, this module
// returns zero bills and an `excluded` list that says `inflow_not_an_outflow`
// for every row, which is a loud, specific, immediately diagnosable answer.
// Taking abs() would instead have produced a confident, plausible, completely
// wrong set of bills. That is the difference this rule buys.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 2. CONFIDENCE IS THE PRODUCT. THE BILL IS JUST WHAT IT IS ATTACHED TO.
// ===========================================================================
//
// A recurring bill is an INFERENCE, not a fact anybody reported. Nobody told us
// the client pays $54.99 every month; we noticed some similar charges and
// guessed. So the guess has to arrive carrying how good it is, and the API is
// shaped so that a low-confidence guess CANNOT be mistaken for a bill:
//
//   result.bills      — medium/high confidence. Safe to show a person as a bill.
//   result.candidates — low confidence. *** THESE ARE NOT BILLS. *** They are
//                       returned so nothing is silently dropped, and they are in
//                       a separate array so that showing one requires asking for
//                       it by name. A caller cannot iterate `bills` and
//                       accidentally render a guess.
//   result.rejected   — groups with no usable cadence at all, each with a reason.
//   result.excluded   — individual rows that could not be used, each with a
//                       reason and its provider id.
//
// *** TWO OCCURRENCES ARE NOT A PATTERN. *** Two charges thirty days apart are
// also just two charges that happened to be thirty days apart. There is no
// third point to confirm anything, so there is no cadence — there is one
// interval, and one interval is a line through two points, which always fits.
// A two-occurrence detection is therefore CAPPED at the 'low' label whatever
// the arithmetic looks like (see capLabelForEvidence), so it can never appear
// in `bills`, and it never gets a next expected date.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 3. A DATE WE DO NOT BELIEVE IS WORSE THAN NO DATE.
// ===========================================================================
//
// When the detector is not confident, `nextExpectedDate` is null AND
// `nextExpectedUnknownReason` is a stable snake_case string saying why. Never a
// plausible date. CLAUDE.md: "Never invent. If information is missing, that
// absence is the finding."
//
// 086 makes this structural rather than a convention: exactly one of
// next_expected_on / next_expected_unknown_reason is non-null, by CHECK. A row
// physically cannot say "I don't know" without saying why, and cannot carry a
// date it does not believe.
//
// The reasons, all of them:
//   two_occurrences_is_a_guess_not_a_cadence
//   confidence_too_low_to_predict_a_date
//   no_occurrence_in_recent_periods_bill_may_have_ended
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 4. `now` IS A PARAMETER. THERE IS NO CLOCK IN THIS FILE.
// ===========================================================================
//
// grep this file for Date.now, new Date() with no argument, or performance.now
// and you will find none. `now` is REQUIRED and detectRecurringBills throws
// without it rather than defaulting — a default clock is the same bug as a
// hidden one, arriving quietly.
//
// It is load-bearing, not decoration. It decides two things:
//   - ROLL-FORWARD: if last-seen + one period is already in the past, the
//     prediction rolls forward; if it has to roll more than MAX_ROLL_FORWARD
//     periods to get past `now`, the bill has probably ENDED and the answer is
//     null-with-a-reason instead of a date.
//   - STALENESS: a bill whose last charge is more than STALE_PERIODS periods
//     old loses confidence, because the strongest evidence that somebody still
//     pays a bill is that they paid it recently.
//
// A function whose answer depends on when it ran cannot be tested or audited.
// Every test in recurring.test.mjs pins `now` and asserts an exact date.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 5. WHAT IS DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED FROM DETECTION, AND WHY.
// ===========================================================================
//
//   PENDING ROWS (`pending_transaction`). A pending authorisation can change
//   amount, change date, or vanish when the merchant releases the hold. If it
//   later posts, the same purchase would appear twice and manufacture a cadence
//   out of one charge — the double-count failure AUDIT-FINDINGS records for the
//   Commas webhook, arrived at from the other direction.
//
//   DUPLICATE PROVIDER IDS (`duplicate_provider_transaction_id`). The database
//   has uq_bank_transactions_account_provider, but this module takes ROWS, not
//   a table, and a caller can hand it the same transaction twice — from two
//   overlapping sync windows, or a naive concatenation. Deduping here means the
//   detector's honesty does not depend on where the caller got the rows.
//   067's rule: you can only dedupe what you can identify. Rows with no
//   provider id are excluded rather than assumed distinct.
//
//   ROWS WITH NO USABLE DATE (`no_posted_date`). posted_on is the settlement
//   date and it is the ONLY date this module uses. authorized_on is NOT
//   silently substituted: the two differ by one to three days routinely, and a
//   cadence computed off a mixture of them wobbles by exactly that much, which
//   is enough to turn a clean monthly bill into an irregular one.
//
//   ROWS WITH NO MERCHANT NAME (`no_merchant_name`). The merchant is the
//   grouping key. With no name there is nothing to group by, and inventing a
//   bucket for them would group a client's unrelated charges into a fictional
//   recurring bill.
//
// Nothing is dropped silently. Every excluded row appears in `result.excluded`
// with its index, its provider id and a reason.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 6. is_business IS NOT INFERRED. EVER.
// ===========================================================================
//
// Nothing in a transaction says whether a charge is business or personal. The
// provider does not know. A merchant name does not say. A category like
// "Utilities" is true of both. It is a property of the ACCOUNT or of a human's
// judgement, and this module does not own the account model.
//
// So `isBusiness` is three-valued and defaults to null = UNKNOWN, never false.
// It is set only from the OPTIONAL `accountIsBusiness` map the caller passes —
// an account-level fact the caller already holds. With no entry for an account,
// the answer is null and `isBusinessUnknownReason` says why. Guessing it from a
// keyword list would be inventing a finance fact about a client's taxes inside
// a regulated consumer-finance product.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 7. MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS AND THIS FILE DOES NO FLOAT ARITHMETIC ON IT.
// ===========================================================================
//
// Amounts arrive as integers, are compared as integers, and the only averaging
// that happens (the median of an even-sized set) goes through
// roundHalfUp() from src/commissions/money.mjs. A row whose amount is not an
// integer is EXCLUDED (`amount_not_integer_cents`) rather than coerced —
// coercing would silently accept dollars where cents were meant and understate
// every bill by a factor of a hundred.
//
// Floats appear in exactly one place: the day-length of a cadence
// (30.4375 days for a month), used to CLASSIFY intervals. No money touches it,
// and the predicted DATE is computed with calendar-month arithmetic, not by
// adding 30.4375 days to anything.
//
//
// ===========================================================================
// 8. KNOWN LIMITATIONS. REPORTED, NOT HIDDEN.
// ===========================================================================
//
// These are gaps, not bugs — the module behaves as described, and what it does
// not do is written down here rather than discovered later. Also recorded on
// the shared board at docs/workflows/finance-os-banking.md under "## W7".
//
//   ONE MERCHANT KEY YIELDS AT MOST ONE CADENCE. Grouping is by
//   (account, merchant_key), so a merchant that genuinely bills monthly AND
//   annually under a BYTE-IDENTICAL descriptor is reported as a single bill,
//   and the weaker of the two patterns is absorbed as fit error and missed
//   periods. In practice providers send distinguishable descriptors for a
//   monthly plan and an annual renewal, and those detect as two bills — which
//   is why 086 keys on cadence as well as merchant. Splitting one descriptor
//   into two cadences needs real data to justify the extra failure mode
//   (a split invents a bill that does not exist), so it is not guessed at here.
//
//   QUARTERLY, SEMI-ANNUAL AND FOUR-WEEKLY ARE NOT IN THE VOCABULARY. A
//   quarterly charge produces ~91-day gaps, which monthly explains as
//   monthly-with-two-missed. That reads as a real monthly bill with a poor
//   payment record and scores lower than it should. Adding cadences is cheap;
//   adding them without data on how often they occur means widening the
//   tolerance bands and merging real distinctions, so it waits for evidence.
//
//   AMOUNT IS NOT USED TO SPLIT A GROUP. Two unrelated charges at the same
//   merchant — a $12 subscription and a $400 one-off — sit in one group, and
//   the one-off shows up as amount spread and costs confidence. It does not
//   fabricate a bill; it makes a real one look worse, which is the safe
//   direction to be wrong in.

 * regular bill looks like it wobbles by up to 2.4 days every single month, and
 * it would be penalised for the calendar's irregularity rather than its own.
 * So the predicted date is built with advance() — real month arithmetic — and
 * the error is the distance from that. A bill on the 15th scores exactly zero
 * error, which is the truth.
 *
 * Each observed gap may span k whole periods, so a SKIPPED MONTH (31, 59, 31)
 * is read as monthly-with-one-missed-payment rather than as no cadence at all.
 * The tolerance widens with k because each unobserved period adds its own drift.
 *
 * `missedPeriods` counts the periods where a charge should have been and was
 * not. It is the primary tie-break, and it is what stops a monthly series being
