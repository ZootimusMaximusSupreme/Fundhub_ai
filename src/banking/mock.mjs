// The mock banking provider. Satisfies the exact plaid.mjs interface so that
// provider.mjs can dispatch to either one and no call site can tell which
// answered.
//
// NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS, for the same reason nothing in plaid.mjs does: there
// is no fetch(), no http client and no scheduler in this file and none may be
// added. This module invents its data. That is the entire point of it.
//
//
// *** DETERMINISTIC. NO Math.random() ANYWHERE. ***
//
// Every figure is produced by a seeded PRNG (mulberry32) whose seed is derived
// from the item id. The same item id yields byte-identical accounts, balances,
// holdings and transaction amounts on every call, forever.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. getAccounts() is expected to be re-read, and
// the store upserts on (plaid_item_id, plaid_account_id). If the mock drifted
// between runs, every refresh would either rewrite every balance with new
// nonsense or — worse, if the ids drifted too — append a second copy of every
// account. The owner would watch his net worth change every time he reloaded a
// page and would have no way to tell that from a real change. A mock that is not
// deterministic is not a mock, it is a random number generator wearing a costume.
//
// THE ONE THING THAT MOVES IS DATES. Transaction dates and balance_as_of are
// relative to `today`, because a bank's history genuinely is. `today` is an
// injectable parameter with the clock as its default, so a test pins it and gets
// a byte-identical answer while production still gets a plausible recent history.
//
//
// *** THE MOCK DOES NOT KNOW WHOSE MONEY IT IS, AND SAYS SO. ***
//
// This file generates accounts that a human would read as business ("Northwind
// Trading Operating") and accounts a human would read as personal ("Everyday
// Checking"). It returns entity_kind NOWHERE.
//
// It would be trivial to tag them, and it would be wrong. plaid.mjs's getAccounts
// header states the rule: accounts arriving from a bank carry no ownership
// information this product can trust, and every row written must keep
// bank_accounts.entity_kind at its 'unknown' default until a human or a document
// establishes otherwise. A mock that helpfully filled in entity_kind would train
// the whole system against a signal the real provider cannot supply, and the day
// someone flipped BANKING_PROVIDER to plaid, every account would go from
// confidently classified to 'unknown' and the Banking Surface screen would empty
// out with no code having changed.
//
// So the mock is deliberately as ignorant as the real thing. The names are a hint
// for the human doing the classifying, not an answer.
