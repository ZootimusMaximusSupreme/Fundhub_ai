// bank_accounts — the writer. This is the module src/banking/plaid.mjs names.
//
// getAccounts()'s header says the account list is "then upserted into
// bank_accounts by a separate store module". That module did not exist: the only
// `INSERT INTO bank_accounts` anywhere in this repository was inside
// src/banking/plaid.pg.test.mjs. Migration 081 shipped a table nothing could
// write to, which is why every bank-derived section of the Money Map is empty.
//
// This file is that module. It is the DATABASE half only — it takes an already
// normalised account list and writes it. It does not know what a provider is,
// does not fetch anything, and holds no clock. src/banking/accounts-sync.mjs is
// what puts a provider on one end of it.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE THREE RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// 1. NULL MEANS UNKNOWN AND MUST SURVIVE THE WRITE.
//    A bank that did not report an available balance has an unknown available
//    balance. Nothing here COALESCEs a balance to 0. 081's header is explicit:
//    the difference "decides whether someone gets funded".
//
// 2. entity_kind IS NEVER SET BY AN INGEST.
//    plaid.mjs's note to whoever built this: "accounts arriving from a bank
//    carry no ownership information this product can trust. Every row written
//    must keep bank_accounts.entity_kind at its 'unknown' default until a human
//    or a document establishes otherwise. Do not map a Plaid subtype onto
//    'personal'." So `entity_kind` is NOT in the column list below, at all — not
//    set to 'unknown', not passed through, not accepted as a parameter. The
//    column default does the work and there is no code path that can override
//    it. 082's provenance CHECK is the backstop.
//
// 3. A SYNC IS A RE-READ, NOT AN APPEND.
//    Upsert on the provider's own key, so running the same sync twice leaves the
//    same number of rows. 086's store gives the same reasoning for bills: run it
//    weekly without an upsert and one subscription becomes fifty-two rows, and
//    any SUM over the table reports a client's money at fifty-two times its true
//    value.
//
//
// WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO: DELETE.
// An account that stops appearing in a provider's list has not necessarily been
// closed — the connection may have partially failed, or the provider may have
// changed how it paginates. Marking `closed_at` on an absence would be a claim
// about a real person's finances derived from a missing row. So a vanished
// account is REPORTED (`vanished` in the result) and left alone. Closing one is
// a decision, and it needs a caller who has made it.
