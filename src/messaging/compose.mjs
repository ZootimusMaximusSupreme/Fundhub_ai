// compose — the staff reply path. A person types words, they go to a client.
//
// THIS IS THE FIRST SEND IN THIS CODEBASE WITH A HUMAN AUTHOR. Every other
// outbound row in `messages` is queued by a workflow reacting to an event, which
// is why src/workflows/messaging.mjs's `staffId` seam has never once been
// supplied. Everything below exists to make a human-authored send obey the same
// rules a workflow's send obeys, and to record the one extra fact a workflow
// send does not have: who wrote it.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHY NOTHING HERE RE-IMPLEMENTS IT.
//
//   the gate         src/messaging/gate.mjs, reached through dispatchMessage.
//                    NOT called directly from here. See the next section.
//   the dispatcher   src/messaging/dispatch.mjs — routing, provider resolution,
//                    quiet-hours deferral, retries, the atomic claim.
//   the thread       src/conversations/store.mjs — the same upsert the inbound
//                    handler uses, so a staff reply and a client's text land on
//                    ONE conversation row rather than two.
//   telemetry        src/shifts/telemetry.mjs — the `text_sent` seam.
//
// The only new SQL here is the INSERT, and it is deliberately the same shape as
// sendTemplated's insert with three differences: no template_key (there is no
// template), compliance_check_passed = false (nothing has checked it yet — the
// gate runs at dispatch, and claiming a pass before the check is exactly the lie
// that column is for), and sender_staff_id set.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THE GATE IS NOT CALLED FROM HERE.
//
// It would be one line and it would be wrong. gate.mjs's own header says opt-out
// state must be read at the instant of sending and never earlier; dispatch.mjs
// is what sends. A gate call here would be a SECOND verdict, taken at a
// different instant from the one that governs the send, and the two would
// disagree the moment a message waits — which is precisely the sleeping-workflow
// bug the gate is built around. One gate, at dispatch, always.
//
// So this function queues a row and then asks the dispatcher to work it now.
// Every rule the dispatcher enforces applies unchanged and unconditionally:
//   * opted out          → blocked, recorded on the row, nothing sent
//   * quiet hours (SMS)  → deferred to 08:00 Arizona, still queued
//   * restricted wording → blocked, and a task is raised for an operator
//   * no routing row     → held, nothing sent
//
// TEMPLATE APPROVAL DOES NOT APPLY, AND THAT IS NOT A BYPASS. Approval
// (116_template_approval.sql) is a check on stored, reusable copy — it asks
// "has a human reviewed this text before we send it ten thousand times". Here a
// human IS the author, reviewing as they type, and there is no template row to
// have a compliance_passed flag on. Note what this does NOT do: it does not skip
// the gate, pass an option to it, or take a different path through it. The
// restricted-wording rules in compliance_rules apply to a staff reply exactly as
// they apply to a template — a phrase an employee may not put in a text is not
// made sayable by typing it by hand.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// IDEMPOTENCY IS OPT-IN, AND ABSENT IS HONEST.
//
// `messages` dedupes on (org_id, provider_ref) — migration 004. A workflow
// synthesises provider_ref from the event id, so a replayed event cannot
// double-send. A person clicking Send twice has no event id.
//
// So the caller may pass `idempotencyKey`, and provider_ref becomes
// `staff:<key>`; a second send with the same key returns the FIRST message
// rather than queueing a second. With no key, provider_ref is NULL — the unique
// index is partial (WHERE provider_ref IS NOT NULL) so NULLs never collide, and
// two identical replies typed a minute apart are two real messages, which they
// are. Nothing invents a key from the body text: two "ok, thanks" replies in one
// afternoon are not a double-send, and silently swallowing the second would lose
// a message a client is waiting on.
