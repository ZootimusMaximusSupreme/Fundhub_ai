/* What is using a message template — the check that stops the editor breaking a
 * live message.
 *
 * A template is referenced from two directions, and they are NOT the same kind
 * of reference:
 *
 *   WORKFLOW CODE — a file in src/workflows names the key as a string, exactly.
 *     `const EMAIL_TEMPLATE_KEY = "EMAIL-F03-ROUND-SUBMITTED"`. This is the one
 *     that really sends. If the key stops matching a row, sendTemplated finds
 *     nothing and returns { sent: false, reason: "template_pending" } — a silent
 *     no-op. The client simply never hears from us and nothing reports an error.
 *
 *   JOURNEY STEPS — a step in the `journeys` table carries a short nickname,
 *     `["Template", "S-01"]`, which src/journeys/runner/diff.mjs resolves by
 *     fuzzy substring. Journeys are a picture of the plan; nothing executes
 *     them, so breaking one of these breaks the health report rather than a
 *     send. It is still a break, and the editor still refuses it — a report that
 *     has gone quietly wrong is how a real gap survives for months.
 *
 * READ-ONLY ON JOURNEYS, ABSOLUTELY. This module reads the journeys table and
 * mirrors diff.mjs's matching rule. It does not import from src/journeys, does
 * not write there, and does not attempt to fix the two known problems with that
 * matching (the fuzzy substring, and the single-brace inline copy the editor
 * stores alongside each step). Both are real and both are separate tickets, by
 * owner decision 2026-08-01.
