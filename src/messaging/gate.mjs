// The outbound messaging gate — the single checkpoint every outbound message
// passes through before any provider is contacted.
//
// This is the messaging sibling of src/compliance/screen.mjs, and it is written
// to that file's posture on purpose. Read its header; the same three properties
// hold here and each one is load-bearing:
//
// 1. DETERMINISTIC. Patterns, a clock and a database row. No model is asked
//    whether a message is safe to send.
//
// 2. FAILS CLOSED ON ANY ERROR. A database that is down, a malformed regex, a
//    message object missing its org — every one returns `blocked`, never
//    `allowed`. The catch at the bottom of gate() is the rule, not tidiness.
//
// 3. THERE IS NO OVERRIDE. No `force`, no `skipCompliance`, no `override`, no
//    `test_bypass`. Not as an argument, not as an option, not as an environment
//    variable, and not "just for tests" — the tests below drive this with real
//    inputs. assertNoBypass() actively rejects an options object carrying one,
//    so an override added by a future caller fails loudly at the gate instead of
//    quietly opening it. Do not add one. If a rule is wrong, fix the rule.
//
//
// WHY THE CLOCK IS AN ARGUMENT.
//
// Quiet hours are a wall-clock question, and a gate that reads the system clock
// directly can only be tested by running the suite at 11pm. `now` is injected so
// every case below states the exact instant it is asserting about. The default
// is the real clock; nothing in production passes one.
//
//
// THE SLEEPING-WORKFLOW CASE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//
// An Inngest workflow can be scheduled on Monday, sleep, and wake on Thursday.
// If the client opted out on Tuesday, that message must not go out — even
// though every compliance check "passed" at the moment it was queued.
//
// The defence is structural rather than a special case: THIS FUNCTION NEVER
// READS WHEN THE MESSAGE WAS CREATED OR SCHEDULED. There is no createdAt, no
// scheduledAt, no queuedAt in the input it consults, so there is no value a
// caller could pass that would make an opt-out recorded after queueing count
// for less than one recorded before it. Opt-out state is read fresh, from the
// database, at the instant of sending. There is no backdating exception because
// there is nothing to backdate against.
//
//
// RETURN SHAPE. { state, reasons[], task } — `state` is 'allowed' | 'blocked'.
// There is no third state and no soft block: anything that is not exactly
// 'allowed' must not reach a provider.
