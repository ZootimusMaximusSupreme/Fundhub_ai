// W4 — the outbound dispatcher.
//
// Takes queued messages that are due, puts each one through the compliance gate,
// and hands the survivors to the provider its org has routed that channel to.
//
// THE ORDER IS THE POINT. gate → route → send, always, with no path that
// reaches a provider without a gate result of exactly "allowed". Every early
// return below happens BEFORE the provider is resolved, which is not a style
// choice: it means a bug in the routing code cannot produce a send, because the
// provider module has not been loaded yet at the moment any block is decided.
//
// NOTHING IS SCHEDULED. This module exports functions. There is no cron, no
// Inngest registration, no timer, and no import of it from any route or
// workflow — dispatchDue() runs when something calls it, and today nothing does.
// Turning sending on is a separate, deliberate act (and INNGEST_EVENT_KEY is one
// of the three things CLAUDE.md §11 says to ask about first). Building the
// dispatcher did not start it.
//
// WHAT PROTECTS AGAINST DOUBLE SENDS. Three things, in order of reliability:
//   1. messages (org_id, provider_ref) unique index, migration 004 — the real
//      guarantee, applied when the row is created.
//   2. claimDue()'s UPDATE ... RETURNING, which flips status to 'sending' in the
//      same statement that selects the row. Two dispatchers racing cannot both
//      claim it; the second sees no row.
//   3. attempts / MAX_ATTEMPTS, which stops an infinite retry rather than a
//      duplicate.
// A plain SELECT-then-UPDATE would satisfy none of them.

/* ── QUIET HOURS ARE A DEFERRAL, NOT A BLOCK ────────────────────────────────
   This is the one place the dispatcher deliberately decides something BEFORE
   the gate, and the reason is a conflict between two of W1's own rules.

   gateAndRecord() persists ANY non-allowed verdict as status='blocked' plus a
   blocked_reason, and 110_messages_outbound.sql states — correctly — that a
   block is an audit record which nothing may clear. Quiet hours are the one
   gate reason that is meant to lapse on its own: the gate marks it
   `retryable: true` and its own message says the text "is being held until the
   window opens".

   Put those together and a text queued at 11pm is blocked permanently and never
   goes out at 11am. The acceptance criterion for this ticket says the opposite,
   and the gate's own wording says the opposite.

   So a text inside the window is never gated at all. It is put back on the queue
   with its due time moved to the next 11:00 Eastern, no verdict is recorded, and
   it is gated fresh when it wakes — which is what the gate's header asks for
   anyway, since opt-out state must be read at the instant of sending and not
   eleven hours earlier.

   This costs nothing in safety. The deferral is strictly narrower than the
   block: it uses W1's own exported window (inQuietHours / QUIET_HOURS_CHANNELS),
   it cannot send, and every other gate reason still runs through gateAndRecord
   unchanged. It is not an override — there is no way to reach a provider from
   here, and no flag makes the window shorter.

   Recorded on the board as a correction to W4, not a silent divergence. */

     `messages` already holds several thousand rows queued by workflows over
     months (110_messages_outbound.sql says so in as many words). None of them

     becomes due at once and goes out — months of stale automated messages
     landing on real people in one afternoon.

     That is not a hypothetical and it is not this feature's decision to make.
     So the sweeper that releases held STAFF replies filters to exactly those:
     `sender_staff_id IS NOT NULL` is true only for rows written by
     src/messaging/compose.mjs, i.e. a message a named employee typed and
     pressed Send on, which was then held for the night. Releasing those is
     what the owner asked for. Draining the legacy workflow backlog is a
     separate, deliberate act by a human and is deliberately NOT done here.
