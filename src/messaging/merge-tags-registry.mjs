/* Which {{merge tags}} a template body may use, and which of them the renderer
 * can actually fill in.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A merge tag is a placeholder — {{contact.first_name}} — that
 * gets swapped for a real value just before a message goes out. If the tag names
 * something the renderer cannot find, src/lib/render-template.mjs substitutes an
 * empty string and warns to the log. Nobody reads that log, so the failure is
 * invisible: the client gets "Hey , quick update" and everything downstream
 * reports success. The template editor is the first place a person types these
 * by hand, so it is the first place that failure can be caught before it ships.
 *
 * THE THREE VERDICTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT JUST OK/NOT-OK.
 *
 *   resolvable    The renderer definitely fills this in. These come off the
 *                 `clients` table via clientContext() in src/workflows/messaging
 *                 .mjs, which is the ONLY context every send path supplies.
 *
 *   unverifiable  Might work, cannot be proven from here. Two cases, both real
 *                 in copy that is already live:
 *                   contact.<anything else> — clientContext spreads the
 *                     clients.custom_fields jsonb into `contact`, and that bag
 *                     holds the 252 ported CRM fields. Whether a given one is
 *                     populated is a per-client fact, not a schema fact.
 *                   custom_fields.* and CLIENT_PORTAL_URL — these are used by
 *                     seeded copy today and DO NOT RESOLVE: nothing supplies a
 *                     `custom_fields` root or that constant, so they render
 *                     blank right now. They are warned rather than blocked by
 *                     an explicit owner decision (2026-08-01): blocking them
 *                     would make templates that already exist impossible to
 *                     edit at all, which fixes nothing and breaks the screen.
 *
 *   unknown       Nothing supplies this under any name. Blocked — but see
 *                 classifyChange() for the one case where it is only warned.
 *
 * PRE-EXISTING UNKNOWNS ARE NOT THE EDITOR'S TO PUNISH. If a row already holds
 * {{user.name}}, refusing every save until someone deletes it means a staff
 * member cannot fix a typo in that template, ever. So the rule is directional:
 * an unknown tag the save INTRODUCES is refused, an unknown tag that was already
 * in the stored copy is reported and allowed through. The editor can never make
 * a template worse than it found it, which is the property that actually
 * matters.
