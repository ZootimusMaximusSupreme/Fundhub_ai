// The sweeper that releases held staff replies.
//
// TWO CLAIMS, and the second one is the one that could hurt somebody:
//
//   1. A text held overnight actually goes out when the window opens. Before
//      this existed it did not — the message was correctly held and then sat
//      queued forever, because nothing in this repository had ever called the
//      dispatcher on a clock. The screen told the sender "it will go out on its
//      own", which was untrue.
//
//   2. It does NOT release anything else. `messages` holds thousands of rows
//      queued by workflows over months and never dispatched. A sweeper that
//      drained the whole queue would put months of stale automated messages in
//      front of real people the first time it ran. That is not this feature's
//      decision to make, so the filter is asserted here rather than trusted to
//      a comment.
//
// THIS SUITE OWNS ITS OWN ORG. Channels route to `memory` on that org only —
// never by UPDATE-ing the default org's message_channel_routing. See
// src/messaging/pg-test-fixture.mjs. Sweep calls also pass orgId so a
// concurrent suite's queued rows cannot inflate claim counts.
