// Bland AI voice — the outbound half of the phone robot.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// Bland voice for Fundhub. Two call shapes:
//   1. placeCall — Agent Editor scripts (`agents.prompt`) to a person's phone
//   2. placeConfiguredCall — bureau IVR configs built in-repo from
//      vendor/inquiry-remover prompts (used by api/inquiry.mjs)
//
// Both transmit only through this provider (CLAUDE.md §12).
//
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN src/messaging/providers/
//
// CLAUDE.md §12: new outbound transmission may only be added here. A phone call
// reaches a person, so it goes behind the MESSAGING fence, which is what
// postJson() from ./http.mjs binds. src/lib/no-unfenced-transmit.test.mjs fails
// the build if any module reaches the network another way.
//
//
// IT IS NOT REGISTERED IN ./index.mjs, ON PURPOSE.
//
// That registry maps a `provider` string from message_channel_routing onto code
// that sends a `messages` row. This sends no message and writes no row — it
// places a call. Registering it would make a voice runtime selectable as a
// channel's SMS or email sender, which is exactly the "typo in a routing row
// silently sends through the wrong provider" failure index.mjs was written to
// prevent. It is reached only through api/agent-call.mjs.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// FOUR THINGS MUST BE TRUE BEFORE A PHONE RINGS. All four fail closed.
//
//   1. BLAND_API_KEY is set.
//   2. The agent is `live`. Promotion is the human review step, and
//      api/agents.mjs refuses to promote without a written prompt and
//      guardrails, so "live" already means "somebody wrote and approved words".
//   3. The agent has a non-empty prompt. Checked again here rather than trusted:
//      db/migrations/037 seeded two live agents with NULL prompts, which is the
//      whole reason this thread exists. Belt and braces on the exact bug that
//      already happened once.
//   4. MESSAGING_DRY_RUN is explicitly off (src/lib/dry-run.mjs). Unset, empty
//      and unparseable all hold the call. Turning it off is the owner's switch,
//      not this module's.
//
// A refusal is never a fake success. Every path returns a named reason.

/* THE NOTICE THAT HAS TO RIDE WITH THE TAPE.
   `record: true` in placeCall's body asks Bland to tape the call. Nothing else
   in this system tells the person that: searched 2026-08-27, there is no
   disclosure in any agents.prompt, in any seeded message template, or anywhere
   else in the repo. Recording someone without telling them is not allowed in
   the two-party-consent states (California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Washington,
   Illinois, Massachusetts and others), and this dials consumers.

   It lives HERE — not in a caller, not in the prompt — for two reasons:

     1. placeCall is the only body in this file that sets `record`, and BOTH of
        its callers reach consumers: api/agent-call.mjs (Agent Editor, placed by
        hand) and src/workflows/ai-set-01-josh-setter.mjs (placed automatically
        on booking.created). Fixing one caller leaves the other silent.
        placeConfiguredCall — the bureau path — sets no `record` and so needs
        none of this; if it ever starts taping, it needs this too.

     2. agents.prompt is owner-editable in the Agent Editor. A notice living
        there can be removed by a save that meant nothing by it, and the tape
        would keep rolling with no words in front of it.

   Binding the words to the same object that carries `record` is what makes
   "taped but not told" unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged. */

       his own instruction sheet out loud — "You are a Fundhub voice agent." — which

       prompt, so the recording notice was never the first thing said on a call that
