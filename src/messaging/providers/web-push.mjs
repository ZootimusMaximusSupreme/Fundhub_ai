// Web push — the only place a notification leaves the building.
//
// CLAUDE.md §12: "Outbound transmission is permitted in src/messaging/providers/*
// and nowhere else." That is why the POST lives here and not in src/push/, and
// why src/push/send.mjs calls this rather than reaching for fetch itself.
//
// SHIPS UNROUTED, DELIBERATELY. `ENABLED = false` and this module is NOT in
// providers/index.mjs. `push` is not a channel in message_channel_routing and
// the dispatcher has never heard of it, so nothing in the message queue can
// reach this code by accident. The one caller today is src/push/send.mjs, which
// the manual test script calls. Wiring it to the nudge dispatcher is a separate,
// deliberate change — the instructions are in docs/journeys/push-flow.md.
//
// WHY IT STILL WEARS THE PROVIDER CONTRACT (PROVIDER / CHANNELS / ADDRESS_FIELD /
// ENABLED / TRANSMITS / send) even though the registry does not hold it: so that
// registering it later is one line in index.mjs and a routing row, with no
// rewrite. index.mjs's import-time checks are exactly the shape asserted below.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE THREE THINGS THIS FILE IS CAREFUL ABOUT
//
// 1. THE PAYLOAD IS BUILT HERE, NOT ACCEPTED HERE. send() takes a notification
//    OBJECT and runs it through buildPushPayload(), which is the lock-screen
//    gate. It deliberately does NOT accept a pre-serialised body: a caller who
//    could hand over finished JSON could hand over "$4,200 due on your Amex"
//    and the gate would never see it.
//
// 2. A DEAD SUBSCRIPTION REPORTS ITSELF. 404 and 410 from a push service mean
//    the endpoint is gone for good. The result carries `gone: true` so the
//    caller retires the row instead of retrying a dead endpoint until the end of
//    time — which is the normal outcome of not handling this, because the push
//    service keeps answering 410 forever.
//
// 3. NOTHING IS LOGGED. No endpoint, no key, no payload, not at any level. The
//    errors below name a status code and a subscription row id and stop.
//
// CONFIGURATION, read at call time:
//   VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY   base64url, 65 bytes — also served to the browser
//   VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY  base64url, 32 bytes. Secret.
//   VAPID_SUBJECT      mailto: or https:// contact for the push services
