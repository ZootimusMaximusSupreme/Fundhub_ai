// The staff reply path, end to end, against a real database.
//
// composeAndSend() is the only thing in this repository that turns typed words
// into an outbound message, and the claim that matters about it is NEGATIVE:
// that it cannot get a message past the compliance gate that a workflow's send
// could not get past. Those cases are the bulk of this file.
//
// WHY THESE ARE pg TESTS AND NOT STUBBED. The gate reads compliance_rules and
// opt_outs from the database, the dispatcher's claim is an UPDATE ... RETURNING
// whose whole point is atomicity, and the thread link is a join across two
// tables. A stub that answered for any of those would be asserting the shape of
// the fake, which is the failure mode AUDIT-FINDINGS warns about. Skipped
// without DATABASE_URL — that is honest, and the request-shape cases that need
// no database live in compose.test.mjs next door.
//
// THIS SUITE OWNS ITS OWN ORG. Channels route to the `memory` provider on THAT
// org only — never by UPDATE-ing the default org's message_channel_routing.
// See src/messaging/pg-test-fixture.mjs for why the shared-org pattern is
// permanently forbidden.
