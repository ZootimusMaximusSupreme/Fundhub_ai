// Survey qualification — the Stage 2 gate (05/30 source of truth, lines 36-44).
//
// Two gates, both must pass to book a funding call:
//   1. cf_svy_self_reported_fico is "700-749" or "750+"
//   2. cf_svy_has_negatives = "No"
// Fail either -> the application-stage credit repair downsell, which under 05/30 is
// OUTSOURCED and automated (dispute-letter referral), NOT an in-house repair track
// (lines 40-41, and the decommission note at 1233-1235).
//
// THE ABSENT CASE IS NOT A FAILURE. Doc line 206: the cf_svy_has_negatives field key is
// "pending from DirectROAS. The Stage 2 gate is not enforceable until it exists." So a
// missing answer resolves to MANUAL_REVIEW — never PASS, never DOWNSELL. Failing open
// sends unqualified people to a funding call; failing closed sends qualified people to
// the downsell. Both are worse than a human looking. The day DirectROAS ships the field,
// real values start arriving and the gate simply begins working — no code change.
//
// Kept in one config module (not inlined in a workflow) so the bands can move without
// touching workflow code, same as lead-temperature.mjs and product-path.mjs.
