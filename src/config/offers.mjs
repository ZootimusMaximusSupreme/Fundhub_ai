       Blueprint service agreement states its own tuition twice — sections 1.3
       and 5.1, "five thousand United States dollars ($5,000)" — and it was
       seeded verbatim in db/migrations/288_real_contract_text.sql. A contract
       that quotes one figure while the pay link charges another is the defect;
       asked which was right, Chris said the contract. So the catalogue moves.

       also 500000, so the education ladder now has two rungs at the same price

       sales question, not a code one, and it is written up in
       docs/workflows/fix-batch-2026-09-03-remaining.md.

       priceMinCents stays $1,000 deliberately. It is the floor a closer may

// is the CLIENT catalogue — line 1 of this file calls it the closer-deck
// catalog, src/sales/closer-deck.mjs feeds every entry of it to the client
// present page through offersForClient(), sendDeckPayLink() will build a
// client pay link for any key in it, and api/pipeline-clients.mjs accepts any
// productCode in it as a product to put a CLIENT on a board. Dropping three
// partner-only add-ons in there would offer a client "Done-For-You Marketing,
// $2,497/month" on the deck. Same shape, same Object.freeze, same integer
// cents, same commasProductTitleFor resolution — separate map, because the
// audience is different.
//
// THE SHAPE GAINS ONE FIELD THE Offer SHAPE HAS NO WAY TO SAY: `billing`.
// Every existing Offer is a single charge on a pay link, so nothing in the
// Offer typedef can express "every month" or "each time one is delivered".
// `billing` says which, and `unitLabel` says what one unit is when the answer
// is per_unit. priceCents stays what it is everywhere else — integer cents for
// ONE billing unit. Nothing existing was bent to fit.
//
// `financing` IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. Whether FundHub finances a monthly
// add-on the way it finances the $10,000 entry is an owner decision nobody has
// made. Absent means not recorded. It is not false.
//
// NONE OF THESE EVER PAYS A PARTNER. They are FundHub revenue: `partnerShare`
// is false on all three, their products.code must never join the partner
// accrual allow-list W1-money-model.md §7 specifies, and no partner_revenue
// row may be written for one. src/config/partner-add-ons.test.mjs holds that.
