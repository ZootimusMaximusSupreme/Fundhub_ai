// Defect (2026-08-22): setupContext resolved the default live company and set
// messaging_settings.outbound_enabled = false. Two production runs paused real
// sending. Snapshot-and-restore is not a safeguard — if the process dies,
// sending stays off. Isolation tests are also a lie on an admin/superuser
// login, because that login bypasses row-level security.
//
// This module must run BEFORE setupContext writes anything. It refuses:
//   1. a privileged database login (superuser or BYPASSRLS)
//   2. a database that already has live (non-demo, non-harness) client files
