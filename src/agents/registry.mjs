// Two agents were recorded as live on Bland AI: Setter Josh and the Inquiry
// Removal AI. Phone inquiry is on hold. 037_agent_registry.sql seeds
// those as live with their runtime recorded and everything else as draft — the
// agent-editor screen shows eleven as live, which is sample data.
//
// Prompts and guardrails ship EMPTY on purpose. The screen carries text for
// fifteen entries but only Setter Josh's is the real live agent's; the rest is
// sample copy, and loading sample prompts into a registry that gates production
// behaviour is worse than leaving them blank. needsAttention() is how that gap
// stays visible rather than being forgotten.
