/* The catalog keys an owner may invite somebody into, plus the labels the
   Staff screen prints for them. A label folds to a key by lower-casing and
   turning runs of whitespace into underscores, so most roles need only one
   entry — "Funding Advisor" already folds to funding_advisor.

   csm is the exception and needs both spellings. Its catalog key is the
   three-letter abbreviation (db/migrations/290_csm_role.sql) while its printed
   name is "Client Success Manager", and those do not fold onto each other.
   Without the alias, an owner choosing Client Success Manager on the Staff
   screen gets `unknown_role` from POST /api/auth/invite and no CSM can be
   created through the app at all — measured live 2026-09-17, when the only
   staff row holding role='csm' in production was the seeded demo one, which
   refuses to authenticate (src/auth/demo-logins.mjs).

   This widens WHO MAY BE CREATED, not what anybody may reach. Every gate the
   role passes through was already open to it before this line existed:
   staff_roles carries csm as active, ROLE_SETS.STAFF in src/http/read-api.mjs
   lists it, and shell.js ROLE_TABS maps it. This was the one place that did
   not, and it sat on the creation path rather than on an access path. */
