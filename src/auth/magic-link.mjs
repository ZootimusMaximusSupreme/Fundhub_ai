// Magic-link sign-in for the client portal.
//
// A client types their email, gets a link, clicks it, and is signed in. There
// is no password anywhere in this path — which is the point, because no screen
// in this repo has ever set a password on an `accounts` row, so the portal has
// had a working session mechanism (044_accounts.sql, account-session.mjs) and
// no way for a client to start one.
//
// IT REUSES THE SESSION PRIMITIVES RATHER THAN GROWING NEW ONES. Same
// newToken() (32 CSPRNG bytes), same hashToken() (sha256, stored instead of the
// token), same scrypt from hash.mjs, and the session it hands back is minted by
// createAccountSession() — the one that already exists. A second token format
// or a second session table is how one of them ends up weaker than the other.
//
// ── THE THREE PROPERTIES THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ──────────────────────
//
// 1. THE ANSWER IS THE SAME FOR AN ADDRESS WE KNOW AND ONE WE DO NOT.
//    requestMagicLink() returns { ok: true } for every well-formed address.
//    Not a different status, not a different message, not a different set of
//    fields. `outcome` is on the return value for the CALLER'S logs and the
//    endpoint does not put it in the response body — an HTTP handler that
//    forwards it turns this form into a membership oracle, which is the exact
//    thing loginAccount() already refuses to be.
//
//    It costs a row either way, too: an address that matches nothing still
//    writes a receipt. That is not bookkeeping, it is what makes the rate limit
//    apply to strangers as well as customers — see the limiter below.
//
// 2. A LINK WORKS ONCE. verifyMagicLink() claims the row with a single
//    UPDATE ... WHERE consumed_at IS NULL AND expires_at > now() ... RETURNING.
//    One statement, so two arrivals with the same token cannot both win: the
//    loser matches no row and gets the same null a forged token gets. A SELECT
//    followed by an UPDATE would let a link-scanning mail gateway and the human
//    who was sent the link both end up with a session.
//
// 3. REQUESTING A LINK CREATES NOTHING. The account is provisioned at
//    VERIFICATION, from the client record the link was bound to. If a request
//    could create an account, spraying addresses would populate `accounts`, and
//    a table of half-real customers is worse than the gap this closes.
//
// NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS. The email is handed to sendTemplated(), which writes
// a `messages` row with status='queued' and stops — dispatch is a separate,
// deliberately unscheduled act (CLAUDE.md §12, src/messaging/dispatch.mjs). So
// this module queues; it does not send, and it does not import a provider.
