// The nine demo logins, as data.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. There are nine roles in public/app/shell.js ROLE_TABS
// (shell.js:120) and, before this file, not one account existed to sign in as.
// The owner could not open the affiliate portal or the white-label partner
// portal to look at them, because he could not get past the login form. Every
// review of every screen was blocked behind that.
//
// WHY A MODULE AND NOT JUST SQL. Same reason src/auth/seed-staff.mjs keeps
// FOUNDING_STAFF as an exported array: a roster that is data can be asserted in
// a test without a database. src/http/demo-logins.test.mjs reads this list and
// public/app/shell.js side by side and fails if a role here is not a role the
// shell grants tabs to — which is the mistake that would produce a demo account
// that signs in and then bounces straight back to the login page.
//
// THE SQL IS STILL THE AUTHORITY for what is actually in the database:
// db/migrations/094_demo_logins.sql writes the rows. This module and that file
// must agree, and the test above is what keeps them agreeing.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE AND MUST NEVER LOOK LIKE THEM.
//
//   · every address is on demo.fundhub.local — a reserved-style .local name
//     that resolves nowhere and can never receive mail, so one of these can
//     never be confused with an employee's or a customer's address;
//   · every name starts with "DEMO ", so a demo row in a staff list, a client
//     list or an assignment dropdown reads as a demo row at a glance;
//   · every row carries is_demo = true (094), so the refusal in
//     src/auth/demo-logins.mjs can key on the ROW and not merely on a string
//     match against the address.
//
// The failure this is written against: a demo account that quietly survives to
// production, on a system holding real consumer-finance customers, and is
// discovered by somebody signing in as "owner" with a password printed on the
// login page. DEMO_LOGINS_ENABLED is the switch that makes that impossible;
// this naming is what makes it obvious before anybody has to look for the
// switch.

// "Setter — Pipeline" tells him what opens. So every entry carries the role in
// his words (`label`) and the SCREEN NAME it opens (`portal`, taken verbatim
// from that file's <title>), and public/login.html renders them as
// "<label> — <portal>".
//
// `lands` stays the machine half and must equal public/app/shell.js HOME[role].
// src/http/demo-logins.test.mjs parses that map out of the shell and fails if
// the two disagree, because a button that signs in and then lands somewhere the
// role cannot open bounces back to the login page — which reads as "the login is
