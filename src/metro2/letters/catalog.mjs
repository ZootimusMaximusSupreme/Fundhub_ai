// THE ROUND LADDER — which document each of the six rounds actually is.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED — dispute logic.
//
// Owner 2026-08-15 (line 2 of this file): the full path after Round 3 is CFPB +
// state AG, from the same engine data.
// Owner 2026-08-28, on the shape of the ladder: "1, 2, 3, escalation,
// escalation, escalation final notice", and on what separates the top three
// rungs from the bottom three: "We just use more aggressive law as we go!"
//
// So each rung stands on a stronger legal footing than the one below it, and
// the authority — not the wording — is what escalates:
//
//   R1  Round 1 Metro 2 dispute      the bureau must reinvestigate
//   R2  Round 2 method of verification   the bureau must show its work
//   R3  Round 3 final notice         delete what you cannot verify
//   R4  CFPB complaint               a federal regulator
//   R5  State attorney general complaint   state consumer-protection law
//   R6  Final notice, reissued       see R6 BELOW — nothing new was invented
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT `promptPoolRound`. `promptPoolRound` in ./prompts.mjs answers a
// different question — "which of the three BUREAU PROSE shapes does a letter for
// this round get written in" — and there are only three of those shapes. It was
// being read as the round ladder as well (src/repair/round-plan.mjs), which is
// how R4, R5 and R6 came to re-emit the Round 2 and Round 3 bureau letters
// forever while CFPB_COMPLAINT and STATE_AG_COMPLAINT, which have existed right
// here in LETTER_TYPES the whole time, were never reached through the ladder.
// The two questions are separate now. This constant is the ladder. That function
// is the prose.
//
// R6 — WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHY, STATED PLAINLY.
//
// There is no eighth letter type called "escalation final notice", and none was
// invented here. R6 reuses R3_FINAL_NOTICE, because a final notice to the bureau
// is exactly what R6 is: the last bureau letter, sent when the two regulator
// complaints have not moved the item either.
//
// R6 DOES NOT SAY, AND MAY NOT SAY, THAT THE COMPLAINTS WERE FILED. Nothing in
// this repository records that a client ever filed one. The pack SHIPS the two
// complaints undated and unsigned inside 06-complaints-CONDITIONAL, behind a
// cover sheet reading DO NOT FILE WITH ROUND 1; the client fills in the date,
// hand-signs the perjury declaration and files them personally. No table, column,
// endpoint or workflow in this repository ever hears whether that happened —
// `dispute_items` records bureau rounds and nothing else. Writing "I have filed a
// CFPB complaint" into R6 would be the identical defect already fixed on main,
// where the Round 3 letter told the bureau a CFPB complaint was being filed and
// no such document had ever been produced. It is not being recreated one rung up.
//
// THAT ABSENCE IS A FINDING, NOT A GAP TO FILL. If R6 is ever to stand on the
// complaints out loud, something has to record the filing first.
