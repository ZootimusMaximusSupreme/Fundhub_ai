/* Fulfillment — THE READ LAYER for src/fulfillment/next-action.mjs.
 *
 * READ ONLY. Every statement in this file is a SELECT. There is no INSERT,
 * UPDATE or DELETE, no migration, no new table and no new column. Nothing here
 * transmits.
 *
 * next-action.mjs decides; this gathers. The split is deliberate — the decider
 * is pure and testable without a database, and the SAME gathered signals feed
 * the client control panel (api/dashboard/client.mjs) and the client list
 * (api/dashboard/clients.mjs) so the two screens cannot show one client two
 * different answers.
 *
 * Phase 0 mapping and the file:line evidence for every signal:
 *   docs/workflows/fulfillment-layer-2026-08-19.md
 *
 *
 * ONE PASS, NEVER A LOOP.
 *
 * The list endpoint asks for a page of up to 500 clients. Every read below
 * takes `clientIds` and answers for the whole page in ONE statement
 * (`client_id = ANY($2::uuid[])`). Nothing in this file runs a query per
 * client, and nothing may be added that does.
 *
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE SEPARATE STATEMENTS AND NOT JOINS ON THE LIST'S OWN SQL.
 *
 * Two of the tables read here arrived late — inquiry_removal_cases in
 * db/migrations/140 and dispute_cases / dispute_responses in 160. Folding them
 * into the list endpoint's main query means a database missing either
 * migration answers the whole client list with a 500 and the screen goes
 * blank. api/dashboard/client.mjs already wraps its inquiry-case read in its
 * own try/catch for exactly this reason ("Table may be absent before migration
 * — never break the dashboard"). So each read stands alone, they all run in
 * parallel, and one of them failing costs one signal, never the screen.
 *
 *
 * DEGRADE HONESTLY, NEVER GUESS.
 *
 * A read that fails answers `null` / `undefined`, not a default. next-action.mjs
 * treats a missing REQUIRED signal as degraded (next_action: null, so the
 * screen falls back to today's display) and a missing OPTIONAL signal as
 * "none". Turning "we could not look" into "there is nothing there" is Phase 0
 * defect 7 and it is not repeated here.

/* ── the six rollups ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Counted in SQL over the SAME filtered population the list draws from — the
   caller's org, and demo clients excluded unless the org has Demo Mode on. The
   list's LIMIT is deliberately NOT applied: a tile that said "12 clients"
   because the page showed 12 would be a lie about the book.

   TWO OF THE SIX ARE null, AND THAT IS THE ANSWER, NOT A GAP (Phase 0 §5):

     ready           Nothing in this system writes a status called "Ready" and
                     no definition exists. Zero would read as "nobody is ready",
                     which is a claim. null is the truth: nothing was recorded.
     total_approved  The honest source is approved amounts on funding rounds and
                     that table has no real rows. Phase 0 also names the
                     "Total Approved" column on another table as the wrong
                     source — its own code comment says the name is historical
                     and the number is a fee calculation.

   needs_pull is "paid, no real credit report on file, AND WRITTEN PERMISSION
   IS LIVE". The consent half is GATE A at the number level and it is not
   optional: without it the tile counted a strict superset of the clients the
   per-client rule (evaluatePullCrs / guardConsentBeforePull) will ever allow a
   pull for, so a tile headed "Needs Pull" listed people nobody may pull for and
   contradicted the chip painted beside it.

   THE CONSENT RULE IS NOT COPIED HERE EITHER. `CONSENT_VALID_SQL` is the same
   imported constant consentSql() above uses and the same predicate the real
   pull endpoint enforces (src/finance/soft-pulls.mjs → consentStatus). EXISTS
   over it is exactly what consentStatus() answers: that function orders valid
   rows first and asks whether the row it picked is valid, so "the picked row is
   valid" and "at least one valid row exists" are the same statement.

   needs_consent is the rest of that population — paid, nothing pulled, and no
   live permission. It is the SAME two halves recombined, so no client can fall
   out of both counts, and it exists so the screen can say where the clients
   that left "Needs Pull" went instead of quietly losing them. It is NOT a
   seventh tile.

   total_prequal is real but thin: Phase 0 measured the whole company total
   coming from ONE client out of 47. total_prequal_clients is returned beside it
   so the screen can say so rather than presenting one person as a company
   total. SUM over no rows is NULL, and it stays NULL — never 0. */

       * a REAL crs_results row (a demo row is not a pull, 148_demo_mode.sql:20);
       * custom_fields.crs_status = 'Complete'.

     THE SECOND ONE IS WHY THIS TILE USED TO DISAGREE WITH THE ROW UNDER IT.
     evaluatePullCrs() (src/fulfillment/next-action.mjs) says NO the moment
     crs_status is Complete, and evaluateGetConsent() says NO too, because
     completedCreditPull() reads Complete as "the credit is in". The tile did
     not look at crs_status at all, so it counted clients no chip would ever be
     painted on: measured on real Postgres, the tile said 4 and only 2 of those
     clients got the chip. A tile that disagrees with the row beneath it is
     worse than no tile.

     TRIM, and IS DISTINCT FROM, to match the decider exactly. next-action.mjs
     compares `str(cf.crs_status) === "Complete"`, and str() trims and treats a
     blank as nothing. IS DISTINCT FROM keeps a missing crs_status — NULL, the
     common case — on the "not complete" side, which is what the chip does with
     an absent value. */
