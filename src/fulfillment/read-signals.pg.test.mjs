/* THE ROLLUP ARITHMETIC AND THE DEMO FILTER, AGAINST A REAL POSTGRES.
 *
 * COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED — one of these counts ("Needs Pull") is a claim
 * about who is waiting on a credit pull.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS THAT THE STUB TEST CANNOT.
 * src/http/dashboard-next-action.test.mjs scripts the database, so it proves
 * the endpoints WIRE the derivation correctly but it cannot execute a single
 * line of SQL. Everything below is arithmetic that only Postgres can settle:
 *
 *   * a DEMO credit row must not count as a real pull, in the tile as well as
 *     in the chip (Phase 0 — api/dashboard/clients.mjs's own crs_count has no
 *     is_demo filter, and that bug must not be repeated in new code);
 *   * a DEMO CLIENT must not appear in any tile while Demo Mode is off;
 *   * "Needs Pull" must count only clients whose WRITTEN PERMISSION IS LIVE,
 *     judged by the one consent predicate the pull endpoint itself enforces —
 *     a tile that counts people nobody may pull for contradicts the chip
 *     beside it (GATE A at the number level);
 *   * "Total Prequal" must stay NULL when nothing was recorded, never 0, and
 *     must report how many clients contributed;
 *   * "Ready" and "Total Approved" must stay NULL because Phase 0 found no
 *     honest source for either.
 *
 * SKIPS WITHOUT DATABASE_URL, which is the default. That is why the wiring
 * assertions live in the stub test instead — those must run on every push.
 *
 * ISOLATION. Everything is created inside a throwaway org of its own and torn
 * down in after(), so this cannot see or disturb another suite's rows.
