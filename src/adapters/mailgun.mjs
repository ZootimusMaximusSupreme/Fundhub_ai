/* ── KEYWORD MATCHING — WORD BOUNDARIES, NOT RAW SUBSTRINGS ────────────────
   FIXED 2026-08-29. This was `lower.includes(kw)`, and a plain substring test
   reads words out of the middle of other words. Every one of these was live:

     "not approved"          contained "approved"  → a denial read as APPROVED
     "refunded"              contained "funded"    → a fee refund read as APPROVED
     "unapproved"            contained "approved"  → APPROVED
     "disapproved"           contained "approved"  → APPROVED

   The first one is the expensive one and it is covered twice over — once here,
   and again by the negation pass below — because a denial misread as an
   approval moves the client's funding card into the approved stage
   (src/workflows/f-11-bank-email-event-router.mjs).

   A space inside a keyword matches ANY run of whitespace. Forwarded plain-text
   bank mail hard-wraps, and "not\napproved" is the same phrase as
   "not approved"; a literal single-space match would miss it and hand the
   email straight back to the bug above. */

/* ── WHAT THE BANK DID TO THE WORD "APPROVED" ──────────────────────────────
   Two modifiers change the decision an email is reporting, and neither can be
   settled by counting keywords — a denial and an approval share almost all of
   their vocabulary. "Unfortunately, you were not approved for the requested
   credit limit" contains the APPROVED keyword "credit limit" fair and square;
   what makes it a denial is the word "not" in front of "approved".

   So these two run BEFORE the keyword contest and remove the APPROVED matches
   outright. The bank has stated its decision; no context word outranks it.

     negated  ("not approved", "unable to approve", "cannot fund")  → DENIED
     reduced  ("approved for a reduced amount")                     → COUNTEROFFER

   The filler list between the modifier and the approval word is deliberately a

   THIS IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM resolveClientFromRecipient BELOW, AND
   CONFLATING THEM WOULD PUT A BANK'S WORDS IN A CLIENT'S MOUTH.

   The inbound mail this adapter was built for is a bank statement forwarded to
   `monitor+<clientId>@fundhub.ai`. There the client is the RECIPIENT — the mail
   is addressed to their monitoring inbox — and the sender is a bank. That is
   what `mail.response` is, and it is why onMailResponse writes a `bank_inbox`
   row and not a message.

   A client replying to an email we sent them is the opposite shape: they are
   the SENDER, and the recipient is one of our own addresses. That is a person
   talking to us, which is the only thing that belongs on their conversation
   thread. The distinction is an observable fact about the payload, not a guess:
   the From address either matches a client record or it does not.

   ORG COMES FROM THE MATCHED CLIENT, not from a default. `clients.email` has no
   unique index in this schema, so two orgs could hold the same address; LIMIT 1
   would then pick one arbitrarily and file a person's email under a company
   that is not theirs. So the org is read off the row that matched, and the

   sibling lookup returns. */

   Opting the person out and telling nobody treats it as a single lost contact.
   It is usually the copy: if a template draws complaints, the next hundred sends
   of it will draw more, and nobody finds that out from an opt_outs row. So the
   complaint raises work for a person, the same way the compliance gate raises
   work when a message uses restricted wording.

   Built through createTask, which is the only sanctioned writer to the tasks
   table (src/lib/create-task.mjs) — src/workflows/task-routing.test.mjs fails
   the build on a raw insert into it anywhere under src/, because a task with no
   owning role is work that reaches nobody. That test greps the file text, so
   this comment says it in words rather than showing the statement.

   THE DEDUPE KEY IS `body`. 006_tasks_idempotency.sql keys on
   (client_id, source_workflow, body), so it must be identical when Mailgun
   retries the same complaint and different for a genuinely new one. The
   provider's message id is exactly that. When the receipt matched no message
   row, the recipient address stands in — one task per complaining address
   rather than one per retry.

   NO MESSAGE COPY IN THE TASK. Same reasoning as the gate: a task list is an
   index over work, not a second outbox holding client-facing text. The template

     Emitted IN ADDITION TO mail.response above, never instead of it, and only
     when the From address matches a client record. See resolveClientFromSender
     for why that condition is the whole of the distinction between "a bank sent
     a statement about this person" and "this person wrote to us".

     WHY message.inbound RATHER THAN A NEW EVENT NAME. src/handlers/comms.mjs
     onMessageInbound already writes the `messages` row, threads it onto the
     client's conversation for that channel, and dedupes on (org, provider_ref).
     It reads the channel off the payload rather than assuming SMS, so an email
     runs the same code path an inbound text does — one handler, one threading
     rule, one dedupe. A second event name would be a second copy of that, and
     the two would drift.

     The STOP/START branch inside that handler NOW FIRES FOR EMAIL TOO
     (changed 2026-08-18, T5-01). It used to be guarded on `channel === "sms"`,
     and the note here defended that on the grounds that "STOP" in an email
     SUBJECT line is not a TCPA keyword. That much still holds — and it is why
     the branch reads the BODY and requires a whole-body exact match, so a
     subject line, a signature block or a quoted thread can never trigger it.
     What it got wrong was concluding that email therefore had no opt-out word
     at all, which left a client who replied "STOP" still on the list.

     `sid` carries the Message-Id because that is the field onMessageInbound
     writes to provider_ref — so a Mailgun redelivery of the same email lands on
     the (org_id, provider_ref) unique index and does not become a second
     message in the thread. An email with no Message-Id gets no dedupe key,
     which the bus already handles the same way for mail.response.

     THE BODY IS CARRIED, and only here. `mail.response` deliberately does not
     carry one — onMailResponse stores `subject` as its own body_preview because
     a forwarded bank statement's text is account detail nobody asked us to
     keep. This payload is a person's own words written to us, which is exactly
     what a conversation thread is, and a thread with the messages missing is
     not a thread. */
  /* WHO REPLIED — THE ADDRESS THEY WROTE TO ANSWERS FIRST.

     addressed to exactly one client. That is deterministic: it does not care
     whether two people share a mailbox, whether they replied from their phone
     rather than the address on file, or whether they changed jobs.

     The From address is the FALLBACK, and it can only answer when it answers
