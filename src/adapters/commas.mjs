// Commas (formerly FanBasis) payment adapter — Master Rebuild Spec Phase 1 (B2).
//
// Commas IS the payment processor. In the platform model an adapter does exactly
// three things and NOTHING else:
//   1. verify the webhook signature (fail-closed),
//   2. normalize the raw body into a flat event,
//   3. emit canonical events onto the bus — handlers (registered elsewhere) react.
//
// ONE THING WAS ADDED TO (2), and it is worth saying out loud because the list
// above is a contract. Before emitting, this file now reads the payment_links
// row the payment came from and resolves WHOSE payment it is. It does that
// because the alternative was worse: every payment event row was being written
// with a null client, so the money landed and nothing could say who paid it,
// and the product bucket was being decided from a vendor product title that no
// link this system mints has carried for years. Both answers live in our own
// database. Reading them is normalisation, not a side effect — the one write
// this path can cause (find-or-create a client by email) is the same write the
// handler on the very next line already made, and is fenced accordingly. See
// resolveInboxClientId().
//
// This is the port of the live underwrite-iq-lite `commas-payment.js` handler.
// The DIFFERENCE: the live handler does GHL/Airtable side effects inline; here the
// adapter only translates money-in → canonical events. The GHL/Airtable/CRS effects
// become handlers on those events (so the same payment can drive many reactions,
// and replay() re-drives them). Routing stays STRICTLY on product NAME, never amount
// (Chris 2026-07-17: deposit + package prices vary per client).

 *
 * COMMAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET is stored on Netlify with --secret, so `netlify env:get`
 * hands back a MASK of asterisks rather than the value. scripts/sim/push-payment.mjs
 * therefore signed every walkthrough receipt with asterisks and this endpoint
 * answered 401 bad_signature — which read like a broken signature and was not
 * (proven 2026-09-03, F26). Rotating the real key would fix it and is forbidden:
 * keys are never rotated here (owner-set, CLAUDE.md section 11).
 *
 * So a SECOND key, SIM_WEBHOOK_SECRET, is set WITHOUT --secret and is therefore
 * readable back. It is still a strong random value — "not secret" means "Netlify
 * will show it to the CLI", not "public".
 *
 * WHAT KEEPS IT FROM BEING A BACK DOOR. The sim key is accepted ONLY for a body
 * that carries the `simulated` marker push-payment.mjs stamps. A real Commas
 * delivery never carries that marker, so a real receipt signed with the sim key
 * is refused, and the sim key can never post money that looks live. The real key
 * keeps working for everything, marker or no marker.
 *
 * Marker position follows the same two payload shapes the parser already handles:
 * enveloped ({data:{simulated:true}}) and flat ({simulated:true}). */

/* PURPOSE → product bucket. THE SIGNAL WE CONTROL, CHECKED FIRST.
 *
 * The four PRODUCT strings above are the titles of products Chris created in
 * the Commas dashboard years ago. Nothing this system mints today is called
 * any of them: a link's title is `description || purpose`
 * (src/payment-links/index.mjs), so the CRM's $32 link is titled "diagnostic"
 * and the closer deck's is titled "UnderwriteIQ soft-pull assessment". Both
 * fell through to "unmatched", so a real payment emitted payment.received and
 * nothing else — diagnostic.paid, deposit.paid and sale.closed never fired
 * from a link we sent.
 *
 * `purpose` is ours. It is written on the payment_links row at mint time from
 * src/config/offers.mjs paymentPurpose, and read back off that row here. It
 * does not depend on what an operator typed in a description box, and it does
 * not depend on a vendor-side product title nobody in this repo can see.
 *
 * ONLY TWO OF THE FOUR PURPOSES ARE IN THIS MAP, and the other two are absent
 * by decision rather than by oversight:
 *   deposit    → the onboarding deposit. deposit.paid. Unambiguous.
 *   diagnostic → the $32 soft-pull gate. diagnostic.paid. Unambiguous.
 *   repair     → NO canonical bucket exists. The nearest, "diy", means the
 *                Consulting Services Package, and posting a repair sale under
 *                it would file it against the wrong product code. Nobody has
 *                decided what a repair purchase should emit.
 *   custom     → free text. It covers the deliverables package, the course,
 *                and anything an operator types. It names no single product.
 * Do not add a row here to make a test green. Adding one decides an offer
 * question, and that is the owner's to decide, not this file's.
 *
 * AN ABSENT PURPOSE FALLS THROUGH, it does not short-circuit. A purpose this
 * map says nothing about contributes nothing, and the title below becomes the
 * only signal left — which for a repair or custom link matches none of the
 * four legacy strings, so the honest answer "unmatched" is what comes out, and
 * payment.received is the only event emitted.
 *
 * THE LEGACY TITLES STAY. Old rows replay through this same function and must
 * classify exactly as they did, and a payment made on a Commas dashboard
 * product page has no link and therefore no purpose — the title is all it has.

 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT HAD TO.
 *
 * This function used to verify, normalise, emit every canonical event and run
 * the entire money chain — client creation, commission accrual, entitlements,
 * closeout — all before returning a status code. That is safe with a provider
 * that retries. Commas does not retry. It delivers AT MOST ONCE, and a
 * delivery that fails is logged on their side and dropped, with no way for us
 * to learn it happened.
 *
 * So under the old shape, any failure anywhere in that chain lost a real
 * payment permanently. A deposit would simply never register, and nothing in
 * the system would be able to say a payment had ever arrived.
 *
 * Now it does the smallest durable thing available: verify the signature,
 * write the exact bytes to commas_inbox, answer 200. One INSERT. Everything
 * else — parsing, mapping, emitting, the money chain — is done afterwards by
 * netlify/functions/commas-inbox-sweeper.mjs, and all of it is retryable
 * because the bytes are already safe.
 *
 * IT NO LONGER RETURNS `emitted`. Callers cannot learn from the response what
 * events a payment produced, because at the moment of responding nothing has
 * been decided yet. That is the trade the at-most-once guarantee costs, and it
 * is the right way round: a caller that wanted the answer synchronously was a
 * caller holding a payment hostage to the money chain succeeding on the first
 * try.
 *
 * A MALFORMED BODY IS STILL STORED. It is verified — it carries a valid
 * signature, so it genuinely came from Commas — and a payload we could not
 * parse but kept is a bug report, while one we refused is a lost payment.
 * Only an unsigned request is refused. */
