// Commas bills subscriptions; we do not.
//
// A checkout session of type "subscription" hands Commas the schedule, the
// card, the retries and the dunning. They charge every frequency_days and
// tell us afterwards. Everything here is about believing those reports
// correctly — and two of them used to be believed WRONGLY:
//
//   subscription.renewed  matched none of the payment keywords and returned an
//                         EMPTY event list. A real recurring charge landed and
//                         nothing recorded it. Invisible until month two.
//   subscription.canceled contains "cancel", so it fell into the
//                         abandoned-checkout branch and a partner who ended a
//                         paid plan looked like someone who never paid.
//
// Both are pinned below. The ordering in mapToCanonical is what fixes them, so
// these tests fail if anyone moves the subscription block after the generic
// keyword matches.
