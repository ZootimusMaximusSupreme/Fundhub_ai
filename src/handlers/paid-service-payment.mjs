// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7) — fee timing. The money for a
// self-serve round has landed. This handler records it and stages the work.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// PAYMENT STAGES THE MAIL. IT DOES NOT SEND IT.
//
// This is the file most likely to be edited into breaking that rule, so it is
// stated here as well as in the module it calls. src/metro2/delivery/send.mjs:3
// and api/repair/send.mjs:3 both forbid mailing from payment.received, in those
// words. What this handler does on a paid round is:
//
//   1. mark the request `paid`, and
//   2. ORDER A FRESH REPORT and put the round on a human's board (`staged`).
//
// It imports no mail function. It emits no event a mailer listens for. There
// are no letters to mail at this point in any case — they are built from the
// report that has only just been ordered. A staff member presses send in the
// existing screen, afterwards, as they always have.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE HANDLER AND NOT A BRANCH IN money-chain
//
// src/handlers/money-chain.mjs already owns payment.received: it writes the
// sale, the transaction and the commissions, and it calls
// grantFromTransaction() (:654) for entitlements. ENTITLEMENTS ARE ITS JOB AND
// STAY ITS JOB — this file does not grant anything, does not call
// grantFromTransaction, and does not invent a second unlock path. That is the
// brief's instruction and it is also the only way the two cannot disagree.
//
// This handler is registered AFTER money-chain, so by the time it runs the
// transaction row and any entitlement grant already exist. Handler order on the
// bus is registration order (src/register-all.mjs), and the bus catches per
// handler, so a failure here cannot roll back the money chain.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// HOW IT KNOWS THE PAYMENT IS FOR A ROUND
//
// It ignores every payment that does not name a paid_service_requests row.
// src/paid-services/checkout.mjs mints the session with metadata
// { link_ref: <request id>, ... } and src/adapters/commas.mjs:237-246 reads that
// bag back out as `payload.ref`. So the reference is the row id, and a payment
// for anything else carries a `pl_…` link ref or nothing at all and is skipped.
//
// NO AMOUNT MATCHING, DELIBERATELY. Matching a payment to a request by its
// dollar amount would attach a client's unrelated $100 payment to a round they
// never asked for. The id or nothing.
//
// ORG IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED. The reference arrives from outside, so the row
// is loaded WITH the event's org id. A reference naming another tenant's
// request finds nothing.
