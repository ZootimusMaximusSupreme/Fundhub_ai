// purchase-routing — the missing first link in the event chain.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR. Fundhub is event-based: landing a card on
// funding_card_stacking / apply_now emits round.started, which assigns the
// funding advisor, provisions the inbox and messages the client. That cascade
// already works. Nothing, however, listened for the PAYMENT and performed the
// move, so a human had to drag the card. When nobody did, no advisor was
// assigned, the client's portal never moved, and the 24-hour guarantee ran out
// unnoticed — the first automatic warning being "deals going cold" seven days
// later, on a screen only the sales manager opens.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE HANDLER AND NOT A FEW LINES INSIDE money-chain. The bus
// (src/events/bus.mjs) wraps each handler in its own try/catch and dead-letters
// its failures individually. Inline, a throw here would reject out of
// recordPurchase AFTER the sale and payment rows had already committed. Kept
// separate, a failure to place a card cannot damage the money record — it lands
// in failed_events where /api/read/failed-events shows it.
//
// HOW THE FOUR SITUATIONS ARE TOLD APART — owner's routing rule, and the two
// signals it needs. These answer different questions and BOTH are required:
//
//   1. WHAT THEY BOUGHT -> products.category on their active sales.
//      'funding' and 'repair' are the two categories that own a board. This is
//      the same basis money-chain.mjs:818 already routes on ("the most recent
//      ACTIVE sale whose product category is 'funding'"), and
//      db/migrations/181 was written around it on purpose: funding-mastery is
//      a $5,000 course filed under 'consulting' precisely so it is NOT a
//      funding signal. Category, not product code: REPAIR_PRODUCT_CODES in
//      src/affiliates/economics.mjs lists only 'repair-bundle', so routing on
//      it would silently give the $200 'repair-trial' buyer no repair card at
//      all. Category catches both.
//
//   2. WHETHER FUNDING IS STILL OWED -> clients.outcome_tier via
//      isFundingPath() (src/config/product-path.mjs), the existing notion of
//      which path a client is on. It cannot decide which boards they belong on
//      by itself: it is the CRS recommendation, not a purchase, so it reads the
//      same for someone who bought funding and someone who only signed for it.
//      Its one job here is separating "both active" from "repair now, funding
//      later" once the purchases are known.
//
//   bought funding, no repair          -> funding board, apply_now
//   bought repair, not on funding path -> repair board, intake
//   bought both                        -> both boards; funding card starts held
//   bought repair, on the funding path -> repair board + client:funding tag,
//                                         and NO funding card
//
// Never funding_altfin (cards move there only from Lendflow webhooks) and never
// inquiry_removal (it starts itself — src/handlers/inquiry-gate.mjs).
//
// SAFE TO FIRE TWICE. State is re-derived from the sales table on every event,
// never from the payload, and a card is placed ONLY when the client has no card
// on that pipeline yet. A replayed event, a duplicated webhook or a second
// payment on the same sale therefore finds the card already there and does
// nothing. That same rule is what stops a client sitting on `funded` being
// dragged back to `apply_now` by a late installment payment.
