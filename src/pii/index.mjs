// PII identity — SSN, DOB and addresses, encrypted at rest and access-logged.
//
// `pii_identity` and `pii_access_log` have been in 001_init since the first
// migration, with a comment saying "encrypted at rest, access-logged, surfaced
// only per the Item 2 visibility spec" — and NO CODE TOUCHING EITHER TABLE. The
// schema promised a control that did not exist. This module is that control.
//
// FOUR RULES, ALL ENFORCED HERE RATHER THAN REMEMBERED BY CALLERS:
//
//   1. ENCRYPTED, OR NOT STORED. AES-256-GCM with the client id as additional
//      authenticated data, exactly as src/adplatforms/tokens.mjs does for OAuth
//      tokens. An unset key stops the feature; it never falls back to plaintext.
//      The AAD binding means an SSN copied into another client's row FAILS to
//      decrypt rather than silently becoming that client's SSN — a mis-joined
//      UPDATE cannot quietly attribute one person's identity to another.
//
//   2. MASKED BY DEFAULT. readIdentity() returns `ssn_last4` and never the full
//      number. Seeing all nine digits requires calling revealSsn() — a separate
//      function with a separate name, so no caller reaches it by accident and
//      every reveal is greppable.
//
//   3. NO LOG ROW, NO PLAINTEXT. The access log is written in the same
//      transaction as the reveal, BEFORE the value is returned. If the log write
//      fails, the reveal fails. An access-logged system whose logging is
//      best-effort is an unlogged system with paperwork.
//
//      THIS RULE DID NOT HOLD FOR THE WHOLE TIME IT WAS WRITTEN DOWN. The
//      ordering below was always right — insert the log row, then decrypt — but
//      it ran under AUTOCOMMIT, so "the same transaction" was not a transaction
//      at all. The local withTransaction() probed
//      `typeof db.connect !== "function"` and ran the callback inline when there
//      was none; src/db.mjs exports `db` as `{ query }` with NO connect(), so on
//      the one handle every production caller passes, the probe took the
//      no-transaction branch every time. A failing log INSERT raised AFTER its
//      own statement had already committed, and a reveal could complete with no
//      log row behind it.
//
//      src/finance/soft-pulls.mjs found this same probe, wrote it up, and
//      correctly refused to change a compliance path it did not own. It is fixed
//      now: the local copy is DELETED and src/db/with-transaction.mjs is
//      imported. src/pii/reveal-transaction.test.mjs proves the rule by making
//      the log write fail and asserting no SSN comes back.
//
//   4. A REASON IS REQUIRED. Every reveal records who, what field, and — via the
//      log's own row — when. "Alvin looked at a client's SSN at 14:32 while
//      working inquiry X" is the answer an audit needs; "someone read the table"
//      is not.
