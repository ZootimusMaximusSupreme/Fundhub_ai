// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED — fee timing. This module prices a self-serve
// dispute round. It charges nobody: it returns line items and a total, and
// something else has to mint a hosted checkout link and record a payment.
//
// Owner-set pricing (2026-09-05), stored as line items rather than as a number
// so a receipt itemises and a later price change does not restate what somebody
// already paid:
//
//   $100 flat per round, covering all three bureaus
//   +$10 when a creditor letter is required
//   +$20 when the CFPB and state attorney general filings are required
//
// Money is integer cents (src/commissions/money.mjs). Nothing here uses floats
// and nothing here rounds, because every price is a whole number of cents.
//
// The CODES are the stable part and the AMOUNTS are not. db/migrations/331
// stores both on the row, checks that the lines sum to the total, and
// deliberately does not CHECK the codes — see that file's header.
