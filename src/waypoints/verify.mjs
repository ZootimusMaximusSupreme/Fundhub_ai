// Close the waypoints the data can actually close, and NOTHING ELSE.
//
// THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE: a waypoint is never marked done on a
// guess. There are exactly two things a fresh credit pull tells us about this
// client's list, and everything else on it stays open until a person says
// otherwise.
//
//   paydown        A re-pull reports the balance on the card. The waypoint
//                  carries the target in integer cents. Balance at or under
//                  target closes it. Above target leaves it open. Card not on
//                  the new file, or a balance the file does not report, leaves
//                  it OPEN — an account we cannot see is unknown, and unknown
//                  is not "paid off".
//
//   no_new_credit  Evidence flows ONE WAY. A revolving account on the new file
//                  that we can POSITIVELY SAY was not on the file at enrolment
//                  is evidence the rule was broken, and the row goes to
//                  'blocked' with the creditor named. Nothing whatsoever is
//                  evidence the rule was KEPT, so this row is never completed
//                  here, not on the last day of the program and not ever.
//
//                  "POSITIVELY SAY" IS THE WHOLE FIX. A reviewer re-pulled a
//                  byte-identical credit file with one creditor string rewritten
//                  from "Credit One Bank" to "CREDIT ONE BANK N.A." and this
//                  code told the client, on their own portal, that they had
//                  opened new credit. Bureaus rename creditors constantly. So an
//                  account is matched by its PRINT — the day it was opened plus
//                  the last four digits of its number — before its name is even
//                  looked at, and when the file does not carry enough to tell a
//                  renamed card from a new one, NOTHING HAPPENS. No block, no
//                  lost paydown, and the reason recorded on the run says which
//                  fact was missing. Unknown is not a denial (CLAUDE.md §12).
//
//                  AND IT IS NOT A ONE-WAY DOOR. A blocked row whose evidence
//                  has gone — the account is no longer on the file, or the
//                  bureau took it off after a correction — goes back to
//                  not_started with its reason cleared. The accusation follows
//                  the evidence in both directions.
//
// A waypoint with a NULL verify_kind is not looked at. NULL means nothing the
// platform can see closes it — the EIN, the business bank account, the LLC
// filing and the personal loan are all in that group, and there is no feed in
// this repository that observes any of them.
//
// AN UNRECOGNISED verify_kind DOES NOTHING. It matches no branch below, so the
// worst a typo in the catalog can do is leave a row open, which is the safe
// direction.
//
// THIS FUNCTION WRITES. It does not send, queue, charge or notify. Telling the
// client is somebody else's job (CLAUDE.md §12 — transmission lives in
// src/messaging/providers/ and nowhere else).
