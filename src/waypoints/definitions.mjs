//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. db/migrations/361 holds the list of tasks as DATA
// because the six-month strategy is not finalised (TODO.md item 0, Chris
// 2026-09-05). This file is the only thing that knows how to turn one of those
// rows into a row of client_waypoints: which tokens the copy supports, how a
// due date is computed, and how the paydown definition becomes one waypoint per
// card. It reads the catalog. It never hardcodes the list.
//
// PURE, DELIBERATELY. Everything below loadWaypointDefinitions() takes plain
// objects and returns plain objects: no db, no clock beyond the `now` handed
// in, no writes. src/waypoints/seed.mjs does the writing. That split is what
// lets the expansion be tested against a hand-written credit file with no
// database at all.
//
// MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS (CLAUDE.md §12, src/commissions/money.mjs). The credit
// file reports balances and limits as DOLLARS, so every number that crosses out
// of here has been through toCents() and every params key that holds money ends
// in _cents.
//
// NULL MEANS UNKNOWN AND IT SURVIVES. A card with no reported limit gets no
// paydown target, because 10% of an unknown limit is not zero and it is not a
// guess we are allowed to make — it gets NO WAYPOINT rather than a waypoint
// with an invented number.

/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ACCOUNT IDENTITY, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE CREDITOR'S NAME.

   MEASURED 2026-09-06. A reviewer re-pulled a byte-identical credit file with
   exactly one string changed — the creditor on one card rewritten from
   "Credit One Bank" to "CREDIT ONE BANK N.A.", which is the sort of thing a
   bureau does to itself constantly. Because every match in this lane keyed on
   slugify(creditor name) alone, that one spelling change produced, in text the
   client reads on their own portal, an accusation that they had opened a new
   credit card. It also lost the paydown on that same card as
   "account_not_on_file".

   NULL MEANS UNKNOWN AND MUST SURVIVE (CLAUDE.md §12). A name we do not
   recognise is UNKNOWN. It is not a new account, and the difference between the
   two is the difference between saying nothing and accusing a client.

   So an account carries a PRINT as well as a name: the day it was opened plus
   the last four digits of its number, both of which the credit file already
   holds and neither of which a bureau rewrites when it tidies up a creditor
   string. Two rows with the same print are the same card whatever it is called.

   WHY THIS READS THE RAW CREDIT FILE. buildBlackReportClient() flattens each
   revolving tradeline to seven display columns — creditor, bureau, balance,
   limit, utilisation, target, status — and the opened date and the account
   number are not among them. They are read here from the tradelines instead of
   being added to that array.

   BOTH HALVES OR NOTHING. An opened date on its own is not identity: two cards
   can be opened the same day. Four digits on their own are not either. A
   tradeline missing either one gets NO print, and every decision downstream
   treats "no print" as unknown rather than as evidence.

 * counted as zero. If NO bureau reports a limit there is no target and the
