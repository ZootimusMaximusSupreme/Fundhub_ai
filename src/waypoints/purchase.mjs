// Paying for the Capital Blueprint creates the client's checklist.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULE THIS SERVES (Chris, 2026-09-17, verbatim): "I think paying
// for the blueprint should create the client checklist. In my opinion, once
// you've paid for it, the payment process generates waypoints — essentially
// step-by-step instructions like 'do this, do this, do this.' It's a process
// where clients check things off before moving forward. Otherwise, they'll get
// overwhelmed."
//
// WHAT WAS TRUE BEFORE THIS FILE. seedClientWaypoints() had exactly ONE caller
// in the product — src/repair/enroll.mjs:166 — so only a client who enrolled in
// a REPAIR program ever got a checklist. A Capital Blueprint buyer got none.
// Measured on production 2026-09-17: Sim Eleven-Blueprint
// (029964c5-4d8e-47ed-88c9-53ac13863fd4) paid $5,000, and holds zero rows in
// client_waypoints. All three clients anywhere in production who have any
// waypoints at all are repair clients.
//
// WHY THE CATALOG FITS. db/migrations/362_waypoint_definitions_seed.sql says in
// its own header that these six tasks ARE the client's own steps out of the
// Credit Optimization Roadmap (scripts/black-reports/fundhub_gen.py). The
// roadmap is the Capital Blueprint's deliverable — it is literally the
// entitlement the Blueprint grants, 'credit-optimization-roadmap'
// (db/migrations/383_blueprint_entitlement.sql). So the Blueprint buyer is the
// person these waypoints were written for. Nothing new is invented here; the
// existing catalog is handed to the existing seeder.
//
// NOTHING IS INVENTED FOR A THIN FILE. seedClientWaypoints() reads the client's
// freshest real credit file itself and expandDefinitions() drops any per-card
// step when there are no cards. A Blueprint buyer whose credit has never been
// pulled gets the steps that need no file (the LLC, the business checking
// account, the EIN, the personal loan, the no-new-credit rule) and simply does
// not get a paydown row. A paydown target is a number off a bureau file; with
// no file there is no number, and NULL means unknown and must survive.

 * Build the checklist for a purchase. BEST-EFFORT: never throws.

 * rather than re-reasoned. By the time this runs the payment is taken, the sale
 * row is written and the entitlement is granted. A checklist that could not be
 * built is a checklist to fix — never a reason to lose somebody's payment,
 * their entitlement or their receipt. So the failure is REPORTED in the return
 * value and the caller carries on.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT, and the idempotence is not added here — it is inherited.
 * client_waypoints carries UNIQUE (client_id, key), upsertWaypoint() is an
 * ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE that deliberately does not touch `state` or
 * `completed_at`, and a paydown row is matched to its card by params rather than
 * by key. So a replayed payment event, a reconcile pass run twice, and a
 * backfill run after both of them all land on the SAME rows. Nothing re-opens a
 * step the client already ticked off.
 *

   THE BACKFILL — people who already paid.

   WHY IT HAS TO EXIST, and it is the same reason
   src/entitlements/entitlements.mjs reconcileFromTransactions() has to exist.
   The checklist is written ONCE, at the moment a payment is processed. Shipping
   the hook above therefore gives a checklist to nobody who has already paid.
   Measured on production 2026-09-17: one Capital Blueprint buyer, zero
   waypoints.

   WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FUNCTION AND NOT A LINE INSIDE reconcileFromTransactions.
   That function is the entitlements LEDGER reconciler. Its whole documented
   contract is "make the ledger agree with the mapping table", it is INSERT-only
   against one table, and every safety claim in its header is about grants. A
   checklist is not a grant, it lives in a different table, and folding it in
   would mean an operator who wanted to fix one person's entitlements silently
   rewrote their checklist too. So this mirrors that function's SHAPE — same
   resolver, same succeeded-only filter, same additive promise, same
   scope-to-one-client argument — and stays its own call. An operator runs both,
   in either order, as many times as they like.

   THE PRODUCT IS IDENTIFIED BY resolve_product_id(), the shipped resolver from
   db/migrations/010_products.sql — current product name first, then any alias.
   NEVER by the dollar amount. A transaction whose product_name matches nothing
   is counted and left alone; inventing a product for it would be guessing what
   somebody bought.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/**
 * Give a checklist to every client who already paid for one.
 *
 * ADDITIVE AND RE-RUNNABLE. It calls the same seeder the live purchase path
 * calls, so it inherits the same idempotence: running it twice, or running it
 * after the live hook has already fired, leaves ONE checklist and never
 * re-opens a finished step.
 *
 * Scope it to one client with `clientId`, or leave it out for the whole org.
 *
 * `dryRun: true` resolves and counts exactly as a real run does and writes
 * NOTHING — so the preview is the real answer, not a guess at it.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{scanned:number, clients:number, seeded:Array, failed:Array,
 *                    unresolved:Array, dryRun:boolean}>}
