// Give a client their checklist. This is the thing that did not exist.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN, 2026-09-06, on origin/main 8010b1b9:
// `client_waypoints` has existed since migration 330 and src/waypoints/store.mjs
// has had upsertWaypoint() the whole time, and a grep for every caller of it
// across the repository returned FOUR files — three test files and one manual
// check script under docs/workflows/wave-3-checks/. NOTHING IN THE PRODUCT HAS
// EVER WRITTEN A ROW. So no real client has a checklist, every portal read of
// the table returns the empty list, and any nudge loop built on top of it would
// have nothing to chase. Proved by running it too: enrolling a client on a
// scratch database with this call removed leaves client_waypoints empty.
//
// WHEN IT RUNS. Off the enrolment that already exists — src/repair/enroll.mjs
// emits repair.enrolled and calls this beside it. No second trigger was
// invented, because a second trigger is a second thing to keep in step.
//
// IDEMPOTENT, THREE WAYS OVER:
//   1. client_waypoints has UNIQUE (client_id, key) and upsertWaypoint() is an
//      ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE, so the same key twice is one row.
//   2. That DO UPDATE deliberately does not touch `state` or `completed_at`, so
//      re-seeding never re-opens something the client already finished.
//   3. A paydown row is matched to its account by params, not by its key, so a
//      re-seed after the balances moved updates the card's existing waypoint
//      instead of adding a second one next to it. Existing due dates are kept
//      too — a re-seed must not quietly push a client's deadline forward.
//
// BEST-EFFORT AT THE CALL SITE, NOT HERE. This function throws on a real
// failure and enroll.mjs catches it, because by the time it runs the enrolment,
// the entitlement and the welcome email are already committed and a checklist
// that failed to build must not undo any of them.
