// Which checklist steps a CLIENT may tick themselves, and the one writer that
// ticks (or unticks) one.
//
// THE RULE IS verify.mjs's, NOT A NEW ONE. src/waypoints/verify.mjs opens with
// "a waypoint is never marked done on a guess" and splits the rows by
// verify_kind:
//
//   verify_kind = 'paydown'        Closed ONLY by data — a fresh credit re-pull
//                                  showing the balance at or under target. A
//                                  client ticking it by hand would be a guess.
//   verify_kind = 'no_new_credit'  Never completed, by anything, ever. Nothing
//                                  is evidence the rule was KEPT.
//   verify_kind = any other value  A machine check owns it. Not the client's.
//   verify_kind IS NULL            "stays open until a person says otherwise"
//                                  (verify.mjs, header). THESE are the rows a
//                                  client may tick — today form_llc, get_ein,
//                                  business_checking and personal_loan
//                                  (db/migrations/362).
//
// The key is verify_kind IS NULL, not a list of waypoint keys. The catalog is
// data (db/migrations/361) and will grow; a hardcoded key list would silently
// refuse a new self-attested step, or worse, allow a new machine-checked one.
//
// AND ONLY THE CLIENT'S OWN JOBS. owner_kind = 'fundhub' means it is our step.
// A client saying our step is done is not a person with the facts saying so.
//
// UNTICK. Allowed on exactly the rows a client may tick, and nowhere else. A
// person said it, so a person can take it back. Nothing in store.mjs forbids it:
// markWaypointState() exists to move a row back to a not-done state and clears
// completed_at for the CHECK in 330. The row goes to 'not_started' with the
// reason recorded, so staff can see it was taken back rather than never done.
//
// ONE ROW, FOUND BY ID *AND* ORG *AND* CLIENT. A row that belongs to somebody
// else is returned as null — exactly what a row that does not exist returns —
// so a caller cannot tell the two apart (src/partners/scope.mjs, the comment on
// assertCanReadRow: saying a record exists but is not yours is itself a leak).
