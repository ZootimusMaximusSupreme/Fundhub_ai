// The lock-screen gate, and the send path it sits in.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7) — credit-repair messaging.
//
// THE CLAIM UNDER TEST, and it is a whitelist claim, not a banned-word one:
//
//   With the detail flag off — which is everywhere, today — the set of strings
//   that can reach a push service is FINITE AND WRITTEN DOWN. Every payload
//   buildPushPayload can produce is enumerated below by taking the product of
//   the approved kinds, bodies, titles, urls and tags. Then bodies are generated
//   in bulk — the sentences a reviewer actually got onto a locked screen, plus
//   thousands of machine-made ones — and every single one either throws or
//   lands inside that enumerated set. Nothing is stripped or edited on the way.
//
// WHY A PROPERTY TEST AND NOT A LIST. The gate that was here before was a list
// of about twenty-five lender names and some money-shaped regular expressions,
// and it passed its own examples while letting "You owe 24000 this month. Pay
// 900 today." straight through. A test made of examples can only ever prove the
// examples. This one proves the complement: that the reachable set is closed.
//
// It is tested at BOTH levels, because a gate is only worth what its weakest
// caller is:
//   1. directly against buildPushPayload(), and
//   2. through src/messaging/providers/web-push.mjs's send() with a fake
//      network — decrypting the bytes that fake network was handed and checking
//      the plaintext, rather than trusting that the gate ran.
