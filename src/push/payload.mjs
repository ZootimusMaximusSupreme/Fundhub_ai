// What a push notification is allowed to say. The lock-screen gate.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7) — credit-repair messaging. This
// module decides the words that can reach a client's phone; the lists below are
// the control, not a style guide.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE ONE FACT THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
//
// A push notification renders on a LOCKED PHONE. It is visible to whoever is
// holding it — a partner, a colleague leaning over a desk, a stranger who picked
// it up on a train — with no password and no unlock. Every other surface this
// product has (the portal, an email, a text) requires something. A lock-screen
// banner requires nothing.
//
// So the body of a notification is PUBLIC TEXT. Not "sensitive but encrypted" —
// the encryption in crypto.mjs protects it from the push service in transit and
// stops there. It arrives, it is decrypted, and it is displayed.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY THIS IS A WHITELIST, AND WHY THE DENYLIST THAT WAS HERE WAS REPLACED
//
// This file used to hold a banned-word list: about twenty-five lender names,
// four bureau names, a set of credit-repair words, and a few regular expressions
// for money. Anything NOT on that list went through. A reviewer put all of these
// on a locked screen with the flag off, and every one of them was allowed:
//
//     "You owe 24000 this month. Pay 900 today."
//     "Minimum due 95 by Friday."          "Balance 42.5k due."
//     "Your Prosper loan is past due."     "Bread Financial needs a payment."
//     "Best Egg statement is ready."       "Your Marcus account was updated."
//     "Your OppLoans payment is late."     "Your 90-day late was removed."
//     "Your inquiry removal is done."
//
// There are thousands of lenders and an unbounded number of ways to write a
// number, so a denylist here can only ever be a list of the leaks somebody has
// already thought of. Every lender founded next year is a hole nobody notices.
//
// So the rule is inverted. WITH THE DETAIL FLAG OFF, A NOTIFICATION BODY IS NOT
// FREE TEXT AT ALL. It is chosen by key out of APPROVED_BODIES below — a short
// list of complete, fully-written sentences that hold no client-specific value
// of any kind, and which a person can read end to end in ten seconds. Anything
// else is REFUSED. Not stripped, not trimmed, not escaped: refused, and refused
// permanently rather than retried, because a retry would refuse it again.
//
// The same applies to every other string the payload carries — the title, the
// tap target and the collapse tag are each drawn from a fixed list too. With the
// flag off, the complete set of payloads this function can produce is finite and
// can be written down; src/push/payload.test.mjs writes it down and then proves
// by fuzzing that nothing outside it can be built.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// REFUSED, NOT STRIPPED
//
// A sanitiser that quietly removes "$4,200" leaves "Your  payment is due" and
// nobody ever learns the caller tried. A refusal is loud at the point the code
// is written, which is the only point anybody can fix it.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE DETAIL FLAG
//
// allowDetail: false, everywhere, today. Nothing in this repository sets it to
// true. It exists so that turning detail on later is a one-line change at ONE
// call site with a name a reader understands, rather than a rewrite of this
// gate under time pressure. Flipping it is Chris's call and nobody else's.
//
// Even with the flag on, the length caps and the same-origin check on the tap
// target still apply — the flag lifts the whitelist and nothing else.
