// sendToClient — one notification, every device that client has on file.
//
// THE ONLY CALLER OF THE WEB PUSH PROVIDER TODAY. It sits between the store
// (which holds encrypted credentials) and the provider (which is the only place
// allowed to transmit), and it owns the two jobs neither of them can do alone:
//
//   1. FAN OUT. A person has a phone, a laptop and a tablet. A notification
//      that lands on whichever one they are not holding is a notification they
//      did not get, so it goes to all of them.
//
//   2. RETIRE THE DEAD. A push service answers 404 or 410 for an endpoint that
//      is gone for good, and it will answer that way forever. Not acting on it
//      means retrying a dead phone on every nudge until somebody notices the
//      failure count. So a `gone` result stamps expired_at immediately, in the
//      same pass, without a sweeper and without a human.
//
// NO PARTIAL SUCCESS LIE. The result names how many devices were reached, how
// many were retired and how many failed. "sent" with three dead endpoints is the
// answer that gets a nudge engine believed when it should not be.
//
// NOTHING HERE LOGS AN ENDPOINT OR A KEY. Row ids and status words only.

 *
 * `allowDetail` defaults to false and nothing in this repository passes true.
 * It is here so that turning detail on later is one argument at one call site.
