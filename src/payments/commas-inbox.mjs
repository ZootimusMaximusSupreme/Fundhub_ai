/* The Commas inbox — persistence and draining for the payment queue.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE PROPERTY THIS FILE EXISTS FOR.
 *
 * Commas delivers AT MOST ONCE. No retries, ever. A delivery that fails on
 * their side is logged and dropped, and we are never told. So there is exactly
 * one moment where a payment can be lost: between the bytes arriving and
 * something durable recording them. Every line here is about making that
 * moment as short and as boring as possible — one INSERT of the exact bytes,
 * then answer.
 *
 * Everything after that INSERT is retryable, which is the whole point. A
 * handler that throws, a database blip during the money chain, a function
 * killed by its wall-clock limit — none of them lose the payment, because the
 * row is already there and the next sweep picks it up.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS MODULE DOES NOT IMPORT THE ADAPTER.
 *
 * Draining takes the row processor as an argument rather than importing
 * processCommasInboxRow from commas.mjs. commas.mjs imports `enqueue` from
 * here to write the row, so importing back the other way is a cycle. The
 * sweeper is where the two are joined. It also means this file is testable
 * with a two-line fake processor and no event bus at all.

/* How many times a row is retried before it is left alone.
 *
 * NOT unlimited. A payload that makes a handler throw deterministically will
 * throw on every pass forever, and an inbox that retries it every minute
 * turns one bad payment into a permanent error-log flood that hides the next
 * real failure. Ten passes is roughly twenty minutes of retrying, which
 * covers every transient cause (a database restart, a deploy, a lock).
 *
 * A row that exhausts its attempts stays `failed` WITH ITS BYTES INTACT. It is
 * not deleted and not marked done. Recovering it is a human decision, and
 * `last_error` is there to make that decision possible. */

/* dedupeKeyFor — what makes a re-delivery a no-op.
 *
 * KEYED ON THE PAYMENT, NOT THE ENVELOPE. Commas documents `data.payment_id`
 * as the idempotency anchor and the envelope `id` as per-DELIVERY. Keying on
 * the envelope would mean two deliveries of one payment carry two different
 * keys, both look new, and the money is counted twice — which is the exact
 * failure the old adapter had.
 *
 * The event type is part of the key because one payment legitimately produces
 * several events over its life: succeeded, then later refund.created, then
 * later dispute.created. Those must not collapse into each other.
 *
 * NO PAYMENT ID: fall back to a hash of the exact bytes. A re-delivery is
 * byte-identical by definition, so it still dedupes. Two genuinely distinct
 * payments would have to be byte-identical to collide, which would mean no id,
 * no timestamp and no reference anywhere in the body — a payload nothing could
 * deduplicate by any means. */
