// Decline Autopsy — the report the buyer sees. Six panels, and the two doors.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED. Spec: docs/specs/W3-decline-autopsy.md §9, §10.
//
// THREE RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES IN CODE, NOT IN COPY:
//
// 1. NO EARNINGS CLAIM. FundHub has ZERO measured paid closes. So this report
//    describes TERMS ("50% of the fee") and never OUTCOMES ("you will make
//    $30,000"). Every money figure carries `estimate: true` and an `assumption`
//    naming what produced it. Nothing here is ever aggregated into a public
//    claim, and none of it appears on a public page.
//
// 2. NO CREDIT-OUTCOME CLAIM. Not one sentence says a dispute, a repair or a
//    pull will produce a score, a deletion or an approval.
//
// 3. NULL IS NOT ZERO. A row with no capacity estimate is COUNTED, shown as a
//    dash, and EXCLUDED FROM EVERY TOTAL — with the excluded count printed
//    beside the totals it was excluded from. src/commissions/money.mjs's rule,
//    carried all the way to the screen.
//
// Pure. No clock beyond the `now` you pass it, no I/O, no database.
