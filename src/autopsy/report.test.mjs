/* The Decline Autopsy report — the three rules it has to enforce in code.
 *
 *   1. NO EARNINGS CLAIM anywhere. FundHub has zero measured paid closes.
 *   2. NO CREDIT-OUTCOME CLAIM anywhere.
 *   3. NULL IS NOT ZERO. An unmodelled row is counted, shown as a dash, and
 *      excluded from every total — with the exclusion printed.
 *
 * Pure: no database, no clock beyond the one passed in.
