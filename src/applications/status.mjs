/**
 * Record that a bank approval DOES NOT COUNT toward this round — or put it back.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A round can no longer be marked Funded while any approval on
 * it has no dollar amount (guardFundedAmount, src/funding/card-stacking-rounds.mjs),
 * because we bill a percent of the approvals that carry an amount and a blank
 * one is never invoiced. But some approvals are never going to have an amount:
 * the bank said yes and the client never used the card, or the approval was
 * withdrawn. Without this, one dead row holds a round open forever.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A DENIAL, AND IT MUST NEVER LOOK LIKE ONE. applications.status is
 * what the BANK said, and it is left exactly as it was — 'Approved'. The bank
 * did approve. src/plays/outcomes.mjs reads approval-vs-denial off that column
 * ('Approved' → yes, 'Denied' → no), so writing 'Denied' here would invert the
 * approval rate, and a third status would delete the yes from the report
 * altogether. What we decided to do about the approval is a different fact, and
 * it lives in its own columns (migration 272).
 *
 * WHO AND WHEN ARE THE POINT. This is a decision somebody makes, so it is
 * refused without a staff member to put against it, and it appends an
 * application_decisions row exactly as every status change does — the same
 * audit trail, a different event_type. That row carries status NULL on purpose:
 * an exclusion is not a bank outcome, and listOutcomesForLaterPlays reads
 * `status IN ('Approved','Denied')`, so a NULL keeps it out of the bank yes/no
 * history instead of showing up there as a second, phantom approval.
 *
 * THE AMOUNT IS NEVER TOUCHED. approved_amount keeps its NULL. "We are not
 * billing for this" is not a claim that the bank approved nothing — that claim
 * is a zero, and it is refused on the way in (normalizeApprovedAmount).

 * the screen can read the approval back — to show what was already saved, to

 * still waiting on one.
 *
 * listClientDecisionPlays above cannot answer any of that. It reads
 * application_decisions, throws away every row with no play name, and the
 * amount does not live on that table at all. This reads the applications rows
 * themselves, which is where approved_amount is.
 *
 * NULL SURVIVES. approved_amount comes back exactly as the column holds it —
 * null when nobody has said, a dollar string when they have. Never coalesced
 * to 0: a zero is a claim that the bank approved nothing, and unknown is not
 * nothing.
