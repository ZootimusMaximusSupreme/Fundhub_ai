    /* TIMEOUTS. With none set, pg waits on the OS TCP timeout — a host that
       drops packets rather than refusing them left /api/health hanging for
       ~135 seconds. On a serverless platform the function is killed long before
       that, so the "health never 5xx's" contract broke by timeout rather than by
       any code path: the caller gets a platform 502 and no JSON body at all.

       connectionTimeoutMillis bounds establishing a connection; a blocked host
       now surfaces as a clean, reportable error in a couple of seconds.
       statement_timeout bounds a query that connects but never returns, which
       is the other way to hang past the function's own limit. Both are
       overridable for a slow link or a deliberately long migration run. */

    /* THE 'error' LISTENER. node-postgres emits this on the Pool whenever an
       IDLE client's connection dies out from under it — a pooler (Supavisor,
       PgBouncer) reaping or resetting a backend is exactly this. pg.Pool is a
       plain EventEmitter, and an EventEmitter with no 'error' listener THROWS
       on emit rather than swallowing it, which crashes the whole process.
       That crash is worse than the error itself: every client the pool had
       CHECKED OUT to an in-flight request dies mid-request, never reaching its
       own try/finally's client.release() — the request simply stops existing.
       Those connections are then orphaned at the pooler until it notices the
       socket is gone, which is how a handful of them end up "idle" for
       minutes or stuck mid-reset (DISCARD ALL) rather than cleanly returned.
       Logging and swallowing it here is the documented fix: the pool already
       discards the dead client on its own, so there is nothing left to do but
       not die. */
