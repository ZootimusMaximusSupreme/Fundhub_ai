/**
 * The case queue, oldest first, with the size of the WHOLE queue beside it.
 *
 * Two things changed here on 2026-08-30, and they are the same bug seen twice:
 *
 *  1. ORDER BY was `requested_at DESC` — newest first. With a LIMIT, that means
 *     the rows dropped off the end are the OLDEST ones, which are exactly the
 *     cases the desk exists to clear. A worklist is worked top to bottom, so the
 *     top has to be the oldest.
 *  2. The screen counted its headline over whatever page it happened to get, so
 *     past the limit the number silently under-reported. `total` is COUNT(*) over
 *     the same WHERE clause, before LIMIT, so the screen can say plainly when it
 *     is showing a slice.
 *
 * Returns { cases, total }. Callers that only want rows read `.cases`.

/* ── ONE CLIENT, ONE BUREAU, ONE OPEN CASE ────────────────────────────────
   Measured 2026-09-06 on the funding walkthrough client: four inquiries, SEVEN
   open cases. Three were made at 03:06 when the deposit was paid, before any
   funding round existed. Three MORE — the same three bureaus, exact duplicates
   — were made at 11:20 once a round did.

   Why: src/handlers/inquiry-gate.mjs looks for an existing case with
   `funding_round_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $5`. The first three carry a null
   round. The second trigger arrived carrying a round id, matched none of them,
   and made three fresh ones. If those had ever been sent, every bureau would
   have received the same dispute letter twice.

   Two open cases for the same client and the same bureau is never a real
   situation — it is two letters to one address. So the check lives HERE, at the
   one INSERT every path goes through, rather than in the caller that got its
   own lookup wrong. An existing open case is ADOPTED: it takes the funding
   round if it did not have one, and it is returned in place of a new row, so
   the caller's follow-up writes (letter draft, item count, status) land on the
   case that already exists.

   A case naming NO bureau is never adopted and never adopts. We cannot tell
   what such a case is for, and quietly folding one into another would be a
   guess. It gets its own row and is reported as the anomaly it is.

   NOTHING IS DELETED HERE and nothing is closed. This stops new duplicates; the
   ones already on the database are Chris's call. */
