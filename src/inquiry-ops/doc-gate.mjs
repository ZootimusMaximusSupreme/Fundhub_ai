/* THE SIGNATURE IS FILED IN A DIFFERENT PLACE FROM WHERE THIS USED TO LOOK.
   Measured 2026-09-06, on the funding walkthrough client: the client signed the
   dispute authorization at 03:04 and this desk said the signed authorization was
   missing — and would have said so forever.

   Signing does NOT write a `documents` row. api/consent/capture.mjs writes ONE
   row, into `client_consents` (db/migrations/099), and its document_id column is
   optional and left null on that path. This packet only ever read `documents`,
   so a signature that exists could never satisfy it.

   Both places count now. A signature is a signature whichever table it landed
   in, and which table that is is our filing detail, not something the client can
   be asked to get right.

   TWO KINDS COUNT, and only these two. `dispute_authorization` is the paper that
   authorises preparing and sending a dispute letter — the exact thing this desk
   does. `soft_pull_consent` counts because the documents side of this same check
   has always counted it (PACKET_SUBTYPES.AUTHORIZATION is that string); refusing
   the consent-table copy of a paper we accept as a document would be the same
   split bug in the other direction. Nothing else is added here: a new kind is a
   compliance decision, not a convenience. */

     A file that arrives with no label is filed as "other", and this packet
     cannot see it — so a client who has sent their photo ID through a door that
     asked them nothing still reads as "photo ID missing". That sentence is
     false, and a person acting on it chases a client who has already done what
     was asked.
     This does not guess what those files are and it does not count them toward
     any leg — a guess is exactly what put a stranger's licence on a client's
     record. It only reports how many arrived that nobody has described, so a
     screen can say "3 files are here that nobody has named" instead of
