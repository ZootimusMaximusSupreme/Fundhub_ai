// withTransaction — a REAL transaction against this repo's actual database handle.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. There are two copies of this helper in the tree already
// and they do not behave the same way:
//
//   src/pii/index.mjs           — probes `typeof db.connect !== "function"` and
//                                 runs the callback inline when it is missing.
//   src/finance/soft-pulls.mjs  — the same probe, then a correction, because the
//                                 probe is WRONG against the handle every
//                                 production caller passes.
//
// THE TRAP, in soft-pulls.mjs's own words: `src/db.mjs` exports `db` as
// `{ query }` and NOTHING ELSE. It has no `connect()`. So the naive probe takes
// the no-transaction branch on the one object every real caller hands in, and the
// callback runs with AUTOCOMMIT — each statement committing itself as it goes.
//
// That is not an abstract concern for the callers in this directory. A revoke
// deletes a credential, cascades a set of accounts, and writes an audit row. An
// erasure writes an audit row and then de-identifies across several tables. Under
// autocommit, a failure halfway through leaves the credential gone and the audit
// row absent, or the audit row present and the removal half-applied. Cascading
// deletes with autocommit is exactly how half-deleted data happens, and
// half-deleted is the one outcome a compliance path may not produce: it is
// indistinguishable from "we did what you asked" and it is not.
//
// This copy is soft-pulls.mjs's corrected version, lifted rather than imported.
// It is not imported from there because that module is the soft-pull fulfil path
// — live, compliant, and explicitly not to be modified — and exporting a helper
// out of it means editing it. Consolidating all three into this one file is the
// right end state and is a cross-module refactor: recorded as a finding on
// docs/workflows/fundhub-beta-buildout.md rather than done as a drive-by.
//
// THE ORDER OF THE THREE BRANCHES IS THE WHOLE POINT:
//   1. the handle has connect()      -> a real Pool, or a test double that wants
//                                       to observe BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK.
//   2. the handle IS the singleton   -> reach past it to the pool it wraps.
//   3. anything else                 -> a plain fake in a unit test; run inline.
// Getting 2 wrong is the bug. Removing 3 breaks every stubbed-db test in the repo.

  // Run inline rather than inventing a transaction it cannot honour.
