// Does every screen actually ASK for its data? — a source-level guard.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, IN PLAIN WORDS
// -------------------------------
// Every screen under public/app/ loads its data layer with
// `<script defer src="data.js">`. "defer" means: do not run this yet, run it
// after the page has finished being read. The plain inline `<script>` just
// below it has no "defer", so it runs WHILE the page is being read — earlier.
// Any code in there that touches `FHData` touches something that does not
// exist yet.
//
// On the calendar that code was written defensively:
//
//     if (typeof FHData !== "undefined" && FHData.wire) { ...ask for tasks... }
//
// That test was never true, not once. The calendar never asked for a single
// appointment. And — this is the expensive part — it did not look broken. It
// painted a clean, convincing, permanently empty week. "Nobody booked anything"
// and "we never asked" looked exactly the same on screen. Confirmed live on
// 2026-08-18: the browser's own fetch was watched and the request to /api/tasks
// simply never happened, while the data layer and the API were both healthy
// (69 tasks, 17 of them dated).
//
// THREE FIXES ARE ACCEPTED, AND THIS FILE RECOGNISES ALL THREE
// -----------------------------------------------------------
//  1. Wait for the page to finish, then ask. calendar.html, pipeline.html and
//     messaging.html do this:
//         document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () { ...ask... });
//  2. Ask now, and if the data layer is not there yet, re-book yourself for
//     later. campaign-manager.html, content-admin.html and creative-factory.html
//     do this, inside the function that does the asking.
//  3. Register the whole start-up function as the thing that runs when the page
//     finishes. hiring.html does this.
//
// Code that only DEFINES a function is always fine — a button handler, a loader
// called later. By the time anything calls it the data layer has loaded. What
// this file hunts for is a read that happens while the page is still being read,
// with nothing arranged to make it happen again later.
//
// THE KNOWN-UNFIXED LIST — READ BEFORE YOU EDIT IT
// -----------------------------------------------
// Other screens still have this bug. They belong to other work threads running
// at the same time, and turning their builds red from here would be noise, not
// signal. So each one is written down below with its owner and what is actually
// wrong with it — every entry was opened and read by hand, not guessed.
//
// That buys three things at once:
//   * this test PASSES today, so nobody has to switch it off;
//   * the debt is WRITTEN DOWN where people read it, with a name on each item;
//   * it FAILS LOUDLY the moment a NEW screen picks the bug up, or the moment
//     calendar.html slips back.
//
// WHEN YOU FIX YOUR SCREEN: delete its one line from KNOWN_UNFIXED. That is the
// whole change. This file then holds your screen to the same bar as the rest,
// and the last test below will tell you (by going red, with the file name and
// the words "delete its line") if you fixed the screen and forgot the line.
//
// You may NOT add a line to KNOWN_UNFIXED to make a new failure go away. A new
// entry would mean a screen shipped that never asks for its data, and the whole
// point of this file is that that never gets to be quiet again.
//
// NOTE ON staff-teams.html: a plain text search makes it look like a match. It
// is not one — its FHData use sits inside a function that only runs on demand.
// It is correctly absent from the list. Do not add it.
