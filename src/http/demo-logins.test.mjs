// The demo-login switch, and the four places the roster is written down.
//
// No database. Everything here is either pure logic (src/auth/demo-logins.mjs)
// or a read of files on disk, so it runs on every `npm test` rather than
// skipping when DATABASE_URL is unset. The behaviour that needs a real Postgres
// — "this account can actually sign in with the flag set" — is in the sibling
// src/http/demo-logins.pg.test.mjs.
//
// WHAT THIS IS GUARDING AGAINST, in order of how expensive it is:
//
//   1. The switch failing OPEN. If DEMO_LOGINS_ENABLED unset ever came to mean
//      "allowed", nine accounts whose password is printed on the login page
//      become live logins on a regulated consumer-finance system, one of them
//      an owner. That is the failure this whole feature is shaped around, so it
//      is asserted first and from several directions.
//
//   2. The roster drifting apart. It is written in FOUR places —
//      src/auth/demo-roster.mjs, db/migrations/094_demo_logins.sql,
//      public/login.html and public/app/shell.js's ROLE_TABS. A role that is in
//      one and not another produces an account that signs in and then bounces
//      straight back to the login page, which reads exactly like "the login is
//      broken" and is not.
