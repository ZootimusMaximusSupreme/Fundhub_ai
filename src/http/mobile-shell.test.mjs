/* The phone-width sidebar. One implementation, in the shell — not 35 copies.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE USED TO ASSERT, AND WHY IT CHANGED. Until 2026-08-05 the phone
 * treatment was pasted into nine screens: each carried its own
 * `@media (max-width:860px)` rule for `.side`, its own `<div id="sideScrim">`,
 * and its own IIFE that forced `.mini` on a narrow load. This file checked for
 * those three things per screen, so it was pinning the duplication in place.
 *
 * None of it ran. shell.js replaces the whole `<aside>` on mount
 * (mountSidebar -> replaceChild), so every listener those scripts bound was
 * attached to an element that no longer existed a moment later. The CSS was
 * worse than inert: `.side:not(.mini)` set `z-index:500` and `width:250px`
 * against the shell's locked 400 and 228, and the forced `.mini` fought the
 * off-canvas drawer the shell now owns.
 *
 * The behaviour moved to crm-sidebar.css plus the lock stylesheet shell.js
 * injects, and the per-page copies were deleted. So the thing worth testing is
 * no longer "does each screen implement this" but its opposite: the shell
 * implements it, and no screen re-implements it.
 *
 * Read as text, same convention as app-nav-reachability.test.mjs — these are
 * static files with no server. Rendered behaviour (the drawer opens, closes on
 * scrim tap, and no screen scrolls sideways at 390px) is covered by
 * docs/workflows/mobile-check.mjs, which drives a real browser.
