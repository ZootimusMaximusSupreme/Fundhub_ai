/* Tests for the client drawer in public/app/pipeline.html — the survey block
 * and the ad-routing lines under "How they got here".
 *
 * Both come from the live walk of 2026-09-03. The drawer painted all four
 * branch questions to everybody, so a client who was never asked about
 * personal income read "—" in the same way a client whose answer went missing
 * did (F8); and gate / entry / primary / secondary never appeared here at all,
 * though the closer screen has read them off /api/read/ad-attribution since
 * the registry landed (F9).
 *
 * The logic is lifted out of the page by the FH-DRAWER markers and run in a
 * sandbox, the same way pipeline-screen.test.mjs tests the summary bar.
