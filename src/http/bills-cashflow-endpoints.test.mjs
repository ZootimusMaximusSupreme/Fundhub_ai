/* The two Finance OS bills / cash-flow endpoints, driven end to end.
 *
 *   api/finance/bills.mjs    — what repeats every month, and the charges behind it
 *   api/finance/cashflow.mjs — whether the account can cover it, and the three
 *                              operator thresholds behind that answer
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHERE IT LIVES. package.json's test glob walks src/
 * and scripts/ ONLY (CLAUDE.md, traps), so a test placed next to the handler
 * under api/ never runs and reports nothing while doing it. It lives here and
 * imports the handlers from api/.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDS NO DATABASE. src/db.mjs exports `db` as a plain object with one
 * `query` method, so both the session lookup and every module call underneath
 * are stubbed and the handlers run exactly as they do in production. Same
 * approach as src/http/subscriptions-endpoints.test.mjs and
 * src/http/finance-os-endpoints.test.mjs, and for the same reason: the tenancy
 * rules these endpoints turn on are INVISIBLE on a one-org database, and every
 * database this repo has is a one-org database.
 *
 * THE SIX THINGS THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING.
 *
 *   1. ORG COMES FROM THE SESSION. Every read and every write must bind
 *      staff.org_id and must never bind an org id from the query string or the
 *      body. A session with no org must match nothing rather than everything.
 *      The evidence read is the sharp one: getBillEvidence() takes no orgId and
 *      filters on none, so the handler's ownership check is the ONLY guard on
 *      that path and this file asserts it runs BEFORE the join.
 *
 *   2. A CANDIDATE IS NOT A BILL. The detector, the store and the seam all keep
 *      low-confidence guesses in a separate list, and an endpoint that merged
 *      them back into one array would undo all three at once. `candidates` must
 *      stay empty unless the caller asked by name — and `candidate_count` must
 *      be honest either way, so a screen can say what it is not showing.
 *
 *   3. THE PROJECTION GETS BILLS IN THE CAMELCASE VOCABULARY. Feeding raw
 *      snake_case rows to the cash-flow seam throws NOTHING and produces a
 *      client with no bills at all, which reads as "you are fine"
 *      (src/banking/recurring.mjs:1169). The test feeds real column names and
 *      asserts the bill reaches the projection.
 *
 *   4. AN UNKNOWN IS NOT ZERO. A NULL balance must refuse the whole projection
 *      rather than being summed as nothing; a NULL threshold must come back as
 *      an ABSENT key rather than a 0; and clearing a threshold must write NULL
 *      rather than COALESCE to zero.
 *
 *   5. A SIGN-OFF BELONGS TO A NUMBER. Changing a value must clear its
 *      signature, and signing off is refused unless the value is in the same
 *      request — otherwise a NULL can be signed off and drops out of
 *      v_cashflow_config_gaps while it is still unset.
 *
 *   6. A REFUSAL IS NOT A CRASH. A missing horizon, a percentage typed into a
 *      fraction field, a card belonging to another client and an unknown
 *      sign_off name are each asserted to be a 400 carrying a sentence, not an
 *      unhandled throw that netlify/functions/api.mjs:334 renders as HTTP 500
 *      "the server broke".

     Without DATABASE_URL that reach throws, and the handler cannot be exercised.

     So the seam is stubbed HERE, at the same object the test already replaces
     `query` on, and the client records BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK. That makes the
     transaction assertable: a detection that half-writes leaves a bill asserting
     a client pays $54.99 a month with nothing behind it, which is worse than not
     writing it at all because it is indistinguishable from a well-evidenced bill
     at every call site that does not join. The COLUMN NAMES the insert uses are
