/* Tests for public/app/client-control-panel.html's two load-bearing decisions,

 *
 * COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED — the first describe below is compliance GATE A
 * as it reaches the screen. Gate A says a client with no recorded consent is
 * NEVER shown "Pull CRS". src/fulfillment/next-action.mjs enforces that in the
 * derivation, but the screen used to undo it: when the derivation came back
 * degraded (which is exactly what a consent read failing produces), the page
 * painted custom_fields.employee_next_action into the big Next Action slot,
 * and that stored string is written without any consent check by
 * src/workflows/s-06-post-call-funding-purchased.mjs:42 and
 * src/workflows/c-05-pre-funding-review.mjs:44 — both of them the literal
 * "Pull CRS". These tests fail if that comes back.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. package.json's test glob is "src/**" and "scripts/**", so
 * a test under api/ or public/ is silently never collected (CLAUDE.md §12).
 * The decisions are pulled out of the page between the FH-CCP-BEGIN/END
 * markers and run with no DOM, the same technique
 * src/http/pipeline-screen.test.mjs uses on that page's FH-LENS block.

   GATE A IN THE PRE-EXISTING BLOCKERS PANEL — the one that was still leaking

   THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. Gate A was enforced inside the derivation, so the
   new control block below was safe. The Blockers panel at the TOP of this page
   is older and is painted straight from the endpoint's raw `open_blockers`
   array — paintBlockers(d.open_blockers, hold) — and so is the new block's
   fallback when no derivation arrives. Both printed the task title verbatim.
   On a real client with no recorded permission the top panel read "Funding
   intake — pull CRS" while the block below it read "waiting on written
   permission": two panels, one screen, contradicting each other.

   Patching each panel is what failed three times. The fix is that the API
   never emits the raw words — api/dashboard/client.mjs runs
   sanitizeBlockerLabels() on the array it sends. These tests paint the REAL
   pre-existing panel function, lifted out of the page, with the REAL sanitizer
   output, so the panel is proved safe without the page being touched at all.
   That the endpoint actually runs the sanitizer is proved in
   src/http/dashboard-next-action.test.mjs.

   THE TILES THAT WERE ALREADY HERE KEEP THE RULE THEY ALREADY HAD

   Prequal and the two income-per-year lines are not part of the fulfillment
   work. The shared money() rule above was briefly wired to them, which changed
   what they printed: a recorded zero became "$0" where it had been a dash, and
   a negative became "$-500". tileMoney() is the rule those displays shipped
   with on main, restored byte for byte.

   Whether a recorded zero on those tiles ought to read "$0" or a dash is
   Chris's call. Until he makes it they read exactly as they read on main.

   ── ONE OF THEM IS NO LONGER FROZEN, AND THIS IS WHY ────────────────────────
   The tile labelled "Total Approved" was in this list, and the assertion below
   pinned `var approved = money(c.funded_amount)` byte for byte. That froze a
   defect: the tile showed the FUNDED amount, and when that was missing it fell
   back to `money(prequal)` — the analyzer's PRE-APPROVAL GUESS, the number in
   the tile immediately to its left — under a label that said Approved. It never
   once showed an approved amount.

   The note above said these were frozen "until Chris makes the call". He has
   made two that settle it:

     * 2026-08-30, fee basis: the success fee is a percent of CONFIRMED
       APPROVALS — approved applications carrying a recorded amount, minus any
       recorded as not counting (src/funding/success-fee.mjs,
       docs/CLOSEOUT-FEE-BASIS.md). A tile labelled Approved that shows the
       funded amount now contradicts the invoice.
     * 2026-08-30, this screen: "never leave a label that does not match its
       number."

   THE HEADLINE NUMBER, AND THE ONE DEFINITION UNDER IT

   The top-left of this screen is now a count: how many bank answers on this
   file say yes and still carry no dollar amount. A number that leads a screen
   has to be provable, so these tests do two things.

   FIRST, they prove the screen answers the same question the server does. Three
   places used to define "a bank yes that is not worth anything yet" and they
   already disagreed:

     src/funding/success-fee.mjs   the biller   NULL or <= 0, not excluded
     api/dashboard/pipeline.mjs    the board    NULL only, exclusion ignored
     client-control-panel.html     the screen   NULL or blank, not excluded

   The two SQL callers now share one string. A screen cannot import a module, so
   its copy is still a copy — and this is what stops it drifting: the SQL string
   is read here and the screen's function is run against the same rows.

   SECOND, they prove the four states are all written in words. This slot is the
   first thing anybody reads, so "we could not check" must never render as an
   all-clear and a real zero must never render as a bare 0 in a box.
