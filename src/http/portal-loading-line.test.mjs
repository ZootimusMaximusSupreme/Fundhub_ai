/* Hole N14, live 2026-09-18 — a good load of the client portal said "We could
 * not load your file" for about a second before the client appeared.
 *
 * Staff opened /app/client-portal.html?id=<#11> and the line under the greeting
 * (#greeting-sub-pre) read "We could not load your file. Use the link we sent
 * you, or sign in again." from first paint until the file read landed — about a
 * second on the hole-13 reviewers' loads, 150–700 ms on the fixer's two looks.
 * The refusal was the line's STARTING text in the markup, so every load showed
 * it, good or bad.
 *
 * The fix: the line starts as loading words. The refusal is painted only when
 * there really is no file at this link — no id at all, or the staff read says
 * the id is no file (not found, or not an id).
 *
 * HOW THIS RUNS THE PAGE. The portal's main script is one DOMContentLoaded
 * handler that exports nothing, so it is EXECUTED — the whole shipped script,
 * not a slice — against a stub browser, the same way as
 * src/http/portal-staff-greeting.test.mjs. The line's starting text is read
 * from the shipped markup, and every text the script writes to it is recorded,
 * so the assertions cover everything a person could see on that line.
