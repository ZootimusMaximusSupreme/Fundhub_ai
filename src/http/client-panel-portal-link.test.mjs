/* Tests for the owner/admin "Send portal sign-in link" control on
 * public/app/client-control-panel.html.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. A client who pays gets an active portal account with a
 * password hash nobody holds. The reset screen they land on tells them to ask
 * an owner or admin for a link — and until this control shipped there was
 * nowhere in the CRM for an owner or admin to press, so the only instruction
 * the product gave a stuck client was impossible to follow (walk finding F31,
 * 2026-09-03).
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. package.json's test glob is "src/**" and "scripts/**", so
 * a test under api/ or public/ is silently never collected (CLAUDE.md §12).
 * This is the sibling of src/http/client-panel-screen.test.mjs and reads the
 * same page the same way.
 *
 * THE CROSS-CHECK IS THE POINT OF HALF OF THESE. The screen's request shape and
 * the screen's role gate are both asserted against api/auth/send-portal-link.mjs
 * itself, not against a second copy typed into this file — so moving the
 * endpoint's body key or widening its role set breaks the screen's test rather
 * than shipping a button that posts a shape nothing reads.
