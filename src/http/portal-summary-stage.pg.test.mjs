// GET /api/read/portal-summary against a real Postgres — the three answers the
// client portal paints its whole screen from.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ON TOP OF src/http/portal-stage.test.mjs. That one proves
// portalStage() is a correct ladder over four booleans. It cannot prove the
// booleans are right, and every one of walk findings F33, F34 and F35 was a
// wrong boolean, not a wrong ladder: the pull HAD run, the call HAD happened, a
// $5,000 agreement HAD been signed, and the screen still said "Your call is
// next". So this file writes the real rows into the real tables and asks the
// real endpoint what it now says.
//
// IT LIVES UNDER src/http/, NOT NEXT TO THE HANDLER. package.json's test glob is
// "src/**" and "scripts/**"; a test placed in api/ is never collected and passes
// forever by never running (CLAUDE.md §12).
//
// THE SESSION IS REAL. requirePrincipal runs against the real account_sessions
// table, so every call carries a token minted for a real row and the "a client
// reads their own file" rule is exercised rather than assumed.
//
// Skipped without DATABASE_URL, like every other *.pg.test.mjs.
