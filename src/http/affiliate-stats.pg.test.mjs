/* GET /api/read/affiliates — do the four numbers on the affiliate screen exist,
 * are they right, and can one affiliate see another's? (T10-04)
 *
 * A pg test rather than a unit test because the thing under test is the SQL.
 * The counting rule this endpoint exists to get right — count referrals from
 * BOTH the structured table and the live capture on clients.custom_fields, then
 * de-duplicate — cannot be exercised without a database, and a handler that
 * answers 200 with a plausible zero is exactly the failure being guarded
 * against.
 *
 * THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS MOST is the last one: a converted referral with NO
 * commission rate in force must stay COUNTABLE as converted while its money
 * stays NULL. affiliate_commission_rules ships empty and AF-04 is undecided, so
 * that is the normal case today, and a COALESCE(commission_due, 0) anywhere in
 * this path would turn "we have not worked out what you are owed" into "you are
 * owed nothing".
 *
 * NO TEST HERE DEPENDS ON ANOTHER ONE RUNNING FIRST. Affiliates alpha and bravo
 * are built once in before() and are READ ONLY — nothing below writes to them.
 * Any test that needs to change data (settle a payout, record a click) builds
 * its own affiliate first and asserts on that. The clicks test used to open
 * with "alpha has 0 clicks", which was true only because no earlier test had
 * inserted one; the payout test used to settle a run against alpha, which any
 * later test reading alpha then had to know about. Keep the rule: if a test
 * writes, it writes to an affiliate it made.
