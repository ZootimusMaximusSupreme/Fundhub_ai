/* WHAT THIS BUTTON DOES CHANGED, AND THE TEST WAS LEFT BEHIND.
   S-23 originally MINTED A PAYMENT LINK here: POST /api/payment-links with
   purpose "invoice". public/app/present.js now reads the client's existing
   invoices and emails the open one instead, and refuses with "No invoice on
   this file yet" when there is none — it creates nothing.

   THE MONEY BUTTON DID NOT GO ANYWHERE. "pay" still fires send_pay_link, and
   the test below this one pins that. So the deck kept its way of taking money
   and gained a separate way of chasing money already invoiced. Emailing an
   existing invoice cannot open a second payment path for a sum already billed,
   which is the direction this repo leans on everywhere else.

   Pinned here: the button exists, it is wired, it emails rather than mints, and
   it can only act on an invoice that is already on the file. */
