// Where people stop watching an ad — the eight columns, against real Postgres.
//
// Two halves, and the second is the one that matters:
//
//   1. THE COLUMNS EXIST AND NULL SURVIVES. A row written with the eight video
//      numbers reads back with those numbers; a row written without them reads
//      back NULL, not 0. That difference is the entire reason
//      db/migrations/378_ad_video_metrics.sql was written: a photo ad has NO
//      such number, a video nobody watched has zero, and a screen must never
//      show those two as the same thing.
//
//   2. THE WHOLE PULL, END TO END, WITH A FAKE META. POST /api/campaigns/sync is
//      driven with an injected fetch that answers exactly the way Meta's
//      documentation says it does — the eight fields come back as LISTS of
//      { action_type, value } objects with STRING values. It asserts that the
//      request asked for all eight, and that the numbers landed in the columns.
//
//      ⚠️ AND THAT NO FIELD NAME IS INVENTED. Meta refuses the WHOLE insights
//      request when one field name is unknown, so one bad name empties spend,
//      clicks and impressions too. We asked for video_3sec_watched_actions
//      until 2026-09-09 and Meta has no such field. The names below are Meta's
//      own, read from facebook_business/adobjects/adsinsights.py.
//
// Lives under src/http/, not next to the handler under api/, because npm test's
// glob is "src/**" and "scripts/**" only (CLAUDE.md §12) — a test file under
// api/ silently never runs while looking green.
//
// ⚠️ NEVER EXECUTED. There is no Postgres on the machine this was written on, so
// the whole describe block skips with DATABASE_URL unset. A skipped
// .pg.test.mjs is NOT green (CLAUDE.md §12). Nothing here has been observed
// passing, and the Meta payload below is written from Meta's documentation, not
// captured from a real ad account.
//
// WHO EACH QUERY RUNS AS. ad_metrics_daily, ads, ad_sets, campaigns and
// ad_platform_connections all carry FORCEd row-level security. A bare db.query
// against one of them is anonymous to those policies and touches ZERO rows
// rather than erroring, so every fixture write and every verification read here
// goes through asStaff(). The bare db.query calls are against partners, staff
// and accounts, which carry no such policy.
