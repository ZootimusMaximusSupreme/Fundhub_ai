/* /api/finance/bank-accounts — the hand-entry writer for `bank_accounts`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND WHERE IT LIVES. package.json's test glob walks src/
 * and scripts/ ONLY (CLAUDE.md, traps), so a test placed next to the handler
 * under api/ never runs and reports nothing while doing it. It lives here and
 * imports the handler from api/.
 *
 * WHY IT NEEDS NO DATABASE. src/db.mjs exports `db` as a plain object with one
 * `query` method, so the session lookup and every statement the handler issues
 * are stubbed and the handler runs exactly as it does in production. Same
 * approach as src/http/subscriptions-endpoints.test.mjs and for the same reason:
 * the tenancy rules this endpoint turns on are INVISIBLE on a one-org database,
 * and every database this repo has is a one-org database.
 *
 * THE FIVE THINGS THIS FILE IS ACTUALLY GUARDING.
 *
 *   1. ORG COMES FROM THE SESSION. Every read and every write must carry
 *      staff.org_id and must never carry an org id from the body. A session with
 *      no org must match nothing rather than everything. The recorded SQL and
 *      its bound parameters are what this is proved against, not the response.
 *
 *   2. A FULL ACCOUNT NUMBER MUST NOT BE STORABLE. The mask box is the only
 *      place on the screen where a person could type one, and 081:60 permits the
 *      last 2-4 digits and forbids the full number and the routing number in the
 *      same breath. The tests send a full number, a routing number and a
 *      decorated mask, and assert each is refused BEFORE any write.
 *
 *   3. UNKNOWN IS NOT ZERO AND UNKNOWN IS NOT PERSONAL. An empty money box must
 *      reach the column as NULL, never 0 — 081:30 says the difference "decides
 *      whether someone gets funded". An unclassified account must stay
 *      'unknown', and a classification with no basis must be refused with a
 *      sentence rather than left to 082's CHECK to answer as a 500.
 *
 *   4. THE SIGN IS DATA. 081:26 refuses a CHECK (>= 0) because "a chequing
 *      account can be overdrawn ... the exact accounts a funding decision most
 *      needs to see". A negative balance must survive the boundary.
 *
 *   5. A REFUSAL IS NOT A CRASH. Everything a caller can get wrong here — a bad
 *      type, a bad currency, a bad date, a float in a cents field, both
 *      spellings of one amount — used to be an unhandled throw, which
 *      api.mjs:334 renders as HTTP 500 "the server broke" for a form somebody
 *      filled in wrong. Each is asserted to be a 400 carrying a sentence.
