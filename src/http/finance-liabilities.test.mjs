/* /api/finance/liabilities, driven end to end against a stubbed database.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT NEXT TO THE HANDLER. package.json's test glob walks
 * src/ and scripts/ ONLY (CLAUDE.md, traps). A test placed under api/ is never
 * run by anything and reports nothing, forever. So the test sits in src/http/
 * and imports the api/ handler, which is the convention the rest of this
 * directory follows.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS WITHOUT POSTGRES. src/db.mjs exports `db` as a plain object with
 * one `query` method, so both the session lookup and the endpoint's own reads
 * can be stubbed and the handler runs exactly as it does in production. Same
 * approach as src/http/finance-os-endpoints.test.mjs, and for the same reason:
 * THE TENANCY BUG THIS GUARDS IS INVISIBLE ON A ONE-ORG DATABASE, and every
 * database this repo has is a one-org database.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED HERE: the `upsert` write path's happy case.
 * recordLiability() reaches past the shared handle for the real pool
 * (src/liabilities/store.mjs:134) so its three writes land in one transaction,
 * which means a stubbed `db.query` cannot observe it — by design, and the design
 * is right. That path is proved against real Postgres in
 * finance-liabilities.pg.test.mjs. Everything BEFORE the store call — the role
 * gate, both tenancy checks and every field parser — is proved here, because
 * every one of those refusals happens before a single write is attempted.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP:
 *   1. A cross-tenant read. src/liabilities/store.mjs's readers take an id and
 *      filter on NOTHING else; the checks in the handler are the only org
 *      filter, so the tests assert on the SQL PARAMETERS actually bound.
 *   2. An unknown becoming a zero. A blank limit is unknown, not $0.
 *   3. An APR off by a hundred (audit m4). "24.99" must reach the column as
 *      0.2499, and the genuinely ambiguous "0.5" must be refused, not guessed.
