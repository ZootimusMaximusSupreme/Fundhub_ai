/* Tests for public/app/messaging.html — the staff reply inbox.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, the same shape as src/http/pipeline-screen.test.mjs:
 *
 *   THE VIEW MODEL. The block between FH-INBOX-BEGIN/END is lifted out and run
 *   in a vm, so the rules with consequences — what a row says, which count is
 *   which, and above all what each send outcome MEANS — are driven directly
 *   rather than inferred from markup.
 *
 *   THE WIRING. Assertions on the page text: that the sample transcript is
 *   gone, that the three reads and the one write are actually called, and that
 *   nothing claims a fact no endpoint answers.
 *
 * THE OUTCOME CASES ARE THE ONES THAT MATTER. A message the compliance gate
 * held and a message queued for the morning are both "not delivered", and if
 * the screen says the same thing about them somebody either retypes a text
 * that is already going out, or believes a blocked one went. That is a real
 * consequence in a regulated product, so each outcome is asserted by name.
 *
 * It lives under src/ rather than public/ because package.json's test glob only
 * walks src/ and scripts/ (CLAUDE.md §12).
