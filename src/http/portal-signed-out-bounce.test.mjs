/* A signed-out client who opens the portal must land on the sign-in page WITH
 * THEIR EMAIL ALREADY FILLED IN.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Owner-set 2026-08-29 ("just send it to the portal"):
 * EMAIL-DS02-DIY-LETTERS-READY stopped linking to /portal-login.html and started
 * linking to the portal itself, {{portal_url}} —
 * /app/client-portal.html?email=<theirs> (clientContext() in
 * src/workflows/messaging.mjs). That is right for a client who is already signed
 * in, and it moves the whole burden of the signed-out case onto ONE line in
 * public/app/shell.js: signInUrl(). If that bounce ever stops carrying ?email=,
 * the new link is strictly WORSE than the one it replaced — the client arrives
 * at an empty box and has to type the address the email already knew. Nothing
 * else in the suite covers that, and it would fail silently and invisibly.
 *
 * HOW THIS TESTS AN IIFE THAT EXPORTS NOTHING. Identical approach to
 * src/http/app-client-carry.test.mjs, which is the file this harness is modelled
 * on: shell.js redirects on load and returns no handle, so it is EXECUTED
 * against a stub browser and the assertions are made on where it navigated.
 * Deliberately not a regex over the source — a text scan would pass on code that
 * never runs, and the whole question here is what the URL ENDS UP as.
 *
 * THE SESSION IS THE VARIABLE. /api/auth/session answering "no" is what a
 * signed-out visitor is, so these tests differ only in that answer and in the
 * query string on the way in.
 *
 * It lives under src/ rather than public/ because package.json's test glob only
 * walks src/ and scripts/ (see the traps section of CLAUDE.md).
