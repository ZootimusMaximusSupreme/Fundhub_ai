/* Postgres-backed tests for the inbound webhook door (src/http/router.mjs).
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS THAT THE STUBBED ROUTER TESTS CANNOT.
 * src/http/router.test.mjs drives handleWebhook against a fake `db.query` and
 * proves the DECISIONS: who is refused, which adapter is reached, what the
 * response body says. It cannot prove that the receipt this door now writes is
 * legal SQL against the real webhook_captures table, that a jsonb column
 * accepts the header map and the decision object being handed to it, or that a
 * refused request leaves the table exactly as it found it. Those are the claims
 * here, and they are asserted against the ROWS, not the responses.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. A signed PostGrid ping (letter.updated) and a signed
 * Bland ping (call not finished) both answered 200 and both did nothing else —
 * correctly, by design, in both cases. But neither left any trace, so an
 * operator staring at a provider dashboard that said "delivered" had no way to
 * tell "we received it and ignored it on purpose" from "it was dropped on the
 * floor". The early returns are unchanged. What is new is the receipt.
 *
 * AND THE GUARD THAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE FEATURE: an UNVERIFIED request must
 * write NOTHING. Capturing unverified traffic would let anyone on the internet
 * fill this table by POSTing garbage at /api/webhooks/<anything>. That is
 * tested explicitly, per provider, below.
 *
 * It lives under src/http/ and not next to the handler because package.json's
 * test glob walks src/ and scripts/ only; a test in api/ is never collected and
 * passes forever by never running (CLAUDE.md, traps).
 *
 * Skipped without DATABASE_URL, like every other *.pg.test.mjs.
