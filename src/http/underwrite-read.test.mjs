       The original assertion here was `assert.rejects(...)`. Its intent was that
       a real outage must not be reported as a clean empty result, and that intent
       is kept and tightened below. What it accidentally also pinned was the
       ROUTE the outage took out of this handler: `throw` lands in
       netlify/functions/api.mjs's catch, which answers 500 internal_error, which
       public/app/data.js words as "something went wrong on our side ... The
       database did not report a problem." That is how a dead database was shown
       on finance-os.html as "Funding capacity could not be read — HTTP 500
       internal_error", pointing whoever read it at this file instead of at
       Postgres.

       So the case now asserts the STATUS rather than the mechanism: 503 carrying
       db:"down", which data.js classifies as source "nodb" and words as "the
       database is not answering". Louder than the old behaviour, not quieter —
