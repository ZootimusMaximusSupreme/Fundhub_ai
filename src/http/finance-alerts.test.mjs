/* /api/finance/alerts, driven end to end against a stubbed database.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT NEXT TO THE HANDLER. package.json's test glob walks
 * src/ and scripts/ ONLY (CLAUDE.md, traps). A test placed under api/ is never
 * run by anything and reports nothing, forever. So the test sits in src/http/
 * and imports the api/ handler, which is the convention the rest of this
 * directory follows.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS WITHOUT POSTGRES. src/db.mjs exports `db` as a plain object with
 * one `query` method, so the session lookup and every read this endpoint issues
 * can be stubbed and the handler runs exactly as it does in production. Same
 * approach as src/http/finance-liabilities.test.mjs, and for the same reason:
 * THE TENANCY BUG THIS GUARDS IS INVISIBLE ON A ONE-ORG DATABASE, and every
 * database this repo has is a one-org database.
 *
 * THE FIVE THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP:
 *
 *   1. A RULE FIRING ON A NUMBER NOBODY CHOSE. 079 ships every rule off with an
 *      empty threshold on purpose. A save that omits `enabled` must leave it
 *      off, and an empty threshold box must reach the column as NULL and never
 *      as 0 — a 0% threshold fires on every client who has any balance at all.
 *
 *   2. A DRY RUN THAT WRITES. The preview runs the real evaluator inside a
 *      transaction it throws away. If it cannot pin a connection it must REFUSE,
 *      because the alternative — running unpinned on the shared `{ query }`
 *      handle, which is audit M7's trap in four other files — writes alerts
 *      about real people while the button says nothing will be written.
 *
 *   3. A SILENT RULE. A rule that is off appears in neither `raised` nor
 *      `skipped`, so a screen fed only the store's answer shows nothing where a
 *      rule should be, and nothing reads as "you are fine". Every rule must come
 *      back with an outcome, including "we did not look".
 *
 *   4. AN UNKNOWN RENDERED AS A NUMBER. A figure the evaluator could not work
 *      out crosses the wire as display:null so the screen can draw an em dash.
 *      Never 0, never "0.00", never 0%.
 *
 *   5. A CROSS-TENANT READ OR WRITE. Every id is bound alongside the SESSION's
 *      org, never the query string's, and the tests assert on the PARAMETERS
 *      actually bound rather than on the response.

     The stub replaces `db.query`, but a preview does not go through `db.query` —
     it asks src/db.mjs for a real pooled connection so it can BEGIN and then
     throw the work away. DATABASE_URL is removed for these two tests so that
     request FAILS, which is the case that matters: the handler must refuse
     rather than fall back to running the evaluator on the shared `{ query }`
     handle with autocommit, which is audit M7's trap and would write real
     alerts under a button that says nothing will be written.

     The other half — that the rollback actually happens when a connection IS
     available — is proved against live Postgres in finance-alerts.pg.test.mjs,
     because whether a transaction rolls back is a property of the database and
     not of anything this file can fake. */
