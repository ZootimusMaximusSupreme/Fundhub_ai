/* /api/finance/model — the deal model, driven end to end against a stubbed
 * database. Plus the one-line defect next door in api/read/tradelines.mjs that
 * let a guardrail be switched off from the address bar.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT NEXT TO THE HANDLER. package.json's test glob walks
 * src/ and scripts/ ONLY (CLAUDE.md, traps). A test placed under api/ is never
 * run by anything and reports nothing, forever. So the test sits in src/http/
 * and imports the api/ handler, which is what the rest of this directory does.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS WITHOUT POSTGRES. src/db.mjs exports `db` as a plain object with a
 * single `query` method, so the session lookup, the ownership check, the trigger
 * configuration read and the tradelines read are all stubbed and the handler
 * runs exactly as it does in production. Same approach as
 * src/http/finance-liabilities.test.mjs, and for the same reason: THE TENANCY
 * BUG THIS GUARDS IS INVISIBLE ON A ONE-ORG DATABASE and every database this
 * repo has is a one-org database.
 *
 * THE FIVE THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP:
 *
 *   1. A GUARDRAIL SWITCHED OFF FROM A URL. api/read/tradelines.mjs:65 took
 *      `?utilization_threshold=` and passed `Number(raw)` into calcFunding with
 *      no check. 0.99 disables the hard stop; "abc" becomes NaN, which loses
 *      every comparison, and disables it while looking like it ran.
 *
 *   2. A CROSS-TENANT READ. The org comes from the SESSION. A client id from
 *      another org must be refused before a card is read, so the tests assert on
 *      THE PARAMETERS ACTUALLY BOUND, not just on the status code.
 *
 *   3. A DEPOSIT THAT RAISES NET CASH. The calculator's own test pins the
 *      arithmetic; this pins that the ENDPOINT does not undo it on the way out,
 *      because the number it returns is the one a closer reads to a client.
 *
 *   4. A FEE PERCENTAGE OFF BY A HUNDRED. "10" in the fee box means 10% to the
 *      person typing it and 1000% to the calculator — a $2.5M fee on a $250k
 *      round, computed without complaint.
 *
 *   5. AN UNKNOWN BECOMING A ZERO. A card with no recorded limit is not a card
 *      with no headroom, and a card with no recorded balance is not a card at 0%
 *      utilization — the second one makes the guardrail optimistic, which is the
 *      one direction a safety gate must not be wrong in.
