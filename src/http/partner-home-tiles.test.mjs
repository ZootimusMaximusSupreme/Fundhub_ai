// GET /api/read/partner-home-tiles — the payload, not the plumbing.
//
// The gate (requirePrincipal, withPartnerScope, staff must name a ?partner_id=)
// is partnerReadHandler's and is tested with the rest of the partner read APIs.
// What is tested here is what this endpoint decides for itself: the day window,
// and the one rule the task depends on getting right — a tile may show a real
// zero, but it may never show a zero, or divide by one, in place of "not known".
//
// It lives under src/ because npm test's glob is src/** and scripts/** only — a
// test under api/ silently never runs (CLAUDE.md §12). No database: fetchRows
// is exercised against a stubbed tx, the same technique
// src/http/partner-production-read.test.mjs uses for its sibling endpoint. The
// real SQL — column names, the v_partner_spend_vs_ceiling join, the RLS scope —
// is proved separately in partner-home-tiles.pg.test.mjs.
