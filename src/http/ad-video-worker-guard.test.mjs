/* The ad-video background worker is an OPEN URL that spends money.
 *
 * It lives at /.netlify/functions/ad-video-worker-background because only a
 * background function gets 15 minutes, and a background function is reached by
 * a request rather than a clock. That means the path is public. A pass of it
 * creates a Submagic project and bills API minutes.
 *
 * So the only thing between the open internet and Chris's Submagic bill is the
 * shared-secret check. These tests are that check's alarm. They never touch a
 * database: every refusal happens before sweep() is called.
