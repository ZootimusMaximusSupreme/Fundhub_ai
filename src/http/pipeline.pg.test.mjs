// api/dashboard/pipeline.mjs is one generic handler for every pipeline key —
// it looks up whatever `key` the caller asks for against the `pipelines`
// table and was never special-cased to "sales". The frontend (pipeline.html)
// used to call it only for Sales and hardcode "no board yet" for the other
// rails without ever asking the backend, which made the endpoint look
// pipeline-specific when it never was. This proves the non-Sales keys answer
// with real stages and cards through the exact same code path Sales already
// used — same auth, same org scoping, same shape.
//
// affiliates_hiring (R-07) is retired; affiliates_white_label and hiring are
// the replacement rails (migrations 115 and 051).
//
// SKIPS unless DATABASE_URL is set. It does NOT pass quietly.

/* A BANK SAID YES AND NOBODY HAS SAID HOW MUCH — surfaced on the board.
   Recording an approval with no dollar amount is allowed (owner-set
   2026-08-29): when a bank comes back the fulfillment team often has to ask the
   client or wait for the bank's approval email before they know the limit. It
   is allowed, but it must not rot — until the dollars are in, that approval is
   left out of the round's lender breakdown and no success fee is ever billed
   for it. So the card carries the fact.

   NULL IS UNKNOWN AND STILL SURVIVES — nothing here turns an unknown amount
   into 0 (CLAUDE.md §12).

   REVISED 2026-08-30. This used to say "NULL ONLY", and that was wrong in two
   ways, both of which were live defects on the board:

     * A recorded 0 is not a fact anybody could bill. guardFundedAmount refuses
       the Funded move on NULL OR <= 0, so a legacy 0 was clean on the board and
       blocked at the move — a wall with no warning in front of it.
     * An approval somebody has recorded as NOT COUNTING (the "Doesn't count"
       button, db/migrations/272_approval_excluded.sql, shipped the same day
       this flag did) still said "Amount needed" on its card, forever.

   The flag now reads the same string the biller reads —
   unpricedApprovalConditions() in src/funding/success-fee.mjs — so the board,
   the Funded guard and the invoice cannot drift apart again. Both cases are
   asserted below. */
