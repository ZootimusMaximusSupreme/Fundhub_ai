/* Tests that every screen the shell will open can actually be reached, and
 * that every screen it opens has a way back out.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR (audit M20). finance-os.html and
 * banking-surface.html were added to the allowed list in public/app/shell.js
 * and to nothing else. No sidebar on any screen linked to either one, so the
 * only way in was typing the path by hand; and neither screen carried a single
 * link of its own, so the only way out was the browser Back button. Two
 * delivered screens that a signed-in employee could not see or leave.
 *
 * The rules under test:
 *   1. Every screen the shell lists is offered by the shared sidebar (the one
 *      partner screen the shell documents as deliberately unlinked excepted).
 *   2. The sidebar is the same on every screen that has one — it is copied
 *      inline into each file, so a row added to some and not others is a
 *      sidebar that changes as you walk around the app.
 *   3. Every screen the shell gates links back out to another screen.
 *   4. The tab count the session chip prints for a staff role is the number of
 *      sidebar rows that role is actually left looking at.
 *
 * It reads shell.js as text rather than executing it: shell.js is an IIFE that
 * redirects on load and exports nothing. The three lists are lifted out of the
 * source, so this goes red if a screen is added to the shell and nowhere else,
 * which is exactly how M20 happened.
 *
 * It lives under src/ rather than public/ because package.json's test glob only
 * walks src/ and scripts/ (see the traps section of CLAUDE.md).
