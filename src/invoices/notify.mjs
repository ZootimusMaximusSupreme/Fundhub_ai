// src/invoices/notify.mjs — an invoice that actually reaches the client.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. `invoices.status` has included 'sent' since 017, and
// markSent() flips it — but nothing has ever emailed one. So "sent" meant
// "somebody pressed a button", and the client heard nothing. Two workflows
// (ds-02, f-07) create invoices automatically, so the platform has been quietly
// raising invoices nobody was told about.
//
// 119 separates the claim from the fact: `status = 'sent'` is what we did,
// `emailed_at` is what actually left. This module is what fills the second one.
//
// NOTHING HERE TRANSMITS. It renders an editable template, writes a `messages`
// row, and asks src/messaging/outbox.mjs to drain. Outbound fetch lives in
// src/messaging/providers/* and nowhere else (CLAUDE.md §12).
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7) — this is fee-timing communication.
// The seeded copy states an amount and a due date and makes no claim about
// credit outcomes; it is editable from the template editor like all other copy.
