// Postgres-backed tests for src/invoices/index.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every function here was already covered by unit tests —
// and every one of them was broken. 031_invoices.sql renamed amount ->
// amount_due, provider_ref -> external_ref and issued_at -> sent_at, and this
// module was never updated, so each call raised SQLSTATE 42703 against a real
// database. The existing tests passed because they run against in-memory fakes
// (src/workflows/test-support.mjs pgFake, and the stub in index.test.mjs) that
// still model the pre-031 column names.
//
// A fake that models the schema you WISH you had cannot fail when the schema
// moves. These tests run the real SQL against real Postgres, so the next rename
// breaks a test instead of a workflow.
