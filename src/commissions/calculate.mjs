// THE CALCULATOR. Given a sale or a funding event, what is owed and to whom.
//
// Pure functions. No database, no clock, no event bus, no writes. Everything —
// prices, rates, splits, dates — arrives as an argument, because every one of
// those is a row a person edits in the admin screen. There is not a single
// product name, dollar amount or percentage hard-coded in this file, and there
// must never be one.
//
// Output is an array of LEDGER DRAFTS: plain objects shaped like
// commission_ledger rows. Writing them is somebody else's job.
//
// The two kinds:
//   front_end — on the sale. Closer earns on deposit COLLECTED, money in the
//               door, not the agreed price at signature (CHRIS PROVISIONAL #4).
//   back_end  — on funding. Earned at round.funded, on THAT round's funded
//               amount, regardless of whether the success fee has been
//               collected yet — that is AR's problem, not the rep's
//               (CHRIS PROVISIONAL #2, #3).
