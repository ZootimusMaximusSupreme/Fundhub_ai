// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md §7) — fee timing and payment rail.
// This module is the whole of the self-serve paid round on the server side:
// what it costs, who may buy one, what happens when the money lands.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT A PAID ROUND IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
//
// Owner-set. It is NOT "mail the letters we already wrote". A client presses
// this when they have stalled or when new damage has appeared, so the request
// path is: price it → take payment → RE-PULL the file → build a dispute off the
// freshest data and the client's own submission history.
//
// That ordering is the product. A round built from a report we pulled in
// January and mailed in April disputes things that may already be gone, which
// is both useless and the kind of letter a bureau learns to ignore.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// TWO INVARIANTS THIS FILE DOES NOT TOUCH
//
// 1. NO SILENT CARD CAPTURE. src/subscriptions/charger.mjs:25 is an empty
//    charger map and :88 is a second env lock. Payment happens on a HOSTED
//    CHECKOUT LINK (src/paid-services/checkout.mjs) and nowhere else. Nothing
//    in this file reads or stores a card.
//
// 2. PAYMENT STAGES THE MAIL. IT DOES NOT SEND IT. src/metro2/delivery/send.mjs:3
//    and api/repair/send.mjs:3 both forbid mailing from payment.received, in
//    those words. So `paid` → `staged` here means "the fresh report is ordered
//    and this is on a human's board", and NOTHING in this module calls a mail
//    function, imports one, or emits an event that one listens to. A staff
//    member still presses send in the existing screen.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// THE TWO COUNTERS ARE INDEPENDENT
//
// `repair_programs.rounds_cap` counts what the client BOUGHT with their program.
// `paid_service_requests.round_no` counts what they have bought a la carte. A
// paid round does not consume a cap round — owner-set — and the enforcement is
// structural: db/migrations/331 gives the table no column referencing
// repair_programs, and no query in this file reads, writes or joins the cap.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// IDEMPOTENCY: A DOUBLE PRESS IS ONE ROW AND ONE CHARGE
//
// Three layers, in this order, because the first two can both be beaten by a
// genuine race and the third cannot:
//
//   1. openRoundFor() — a read. Catches the ordinary second press, seconds
//      apart, and gives the client the row they already have.
//   2. A derived idempotency key `paid_round:<clientId>:r<n>`, so two presses
//      that both slip past (1) build the SAME key rather than two.
//   3. The database. uq_paid_service_requests_idem and
//      uq_paid_service_requests_round_no (both in 331) adjudicate the tie. The
//      loser re-reads and is handed the winner's row with `created: false`.
//
// AND THE CHARGE FOLLOWS THE ROW. The checkout link is minted ONLY when
// `created === true`. A loser never reaches the processor, so one press to a
// row is also one row to a link. This is the part that actually prevents the
// double charge; the guards above only prevent the double row.
//
// This is the shape src/finance/soft-pulls.mjs:267 gave the soft-pull double
// tap, copied rather than reinvented. What is NOT copied is
// src/handlers/money-chain.mjs:396, which dedupes transactions by
// check-then-write on provider_ref with no unique index behind it — that is
// racy and it is not a pattern.

 * that arrives twice is the normal case, not the exception.
 *
 * amountCents may be null — NULL MEANS UNKNOWN. But db/migrations/331's
 * paid_service_requests_paid_ck binds paid_at and amount_paid_cents together,
 * so an unknown amount cannot be stored beside a payment timestamp. When the
 * webhook does not say what was paid we fall back to what was QUOTED, and
 * `payment_amount_source` in `produced` records that we did, so nobody later
 * reads the quoted figure as a confirmed one.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A SHORT PAYMENT IS NOT A PAYMENT. MEASURED DEFECT, 2026-09-05.
 *
 * Until this guard existed, `amountCents: 0` against an $110 round returned
 * `applied: true` with the row at 'paid', and `amountCents: 1` went all the way
 * to 'staged' — a soft pull ordered and the round on a human's board, bought
 * for one cent. Nothing compared the figure the processor reported against the
 * figure the client was billed.
 *
 * So: when the processor STATES an amount and the row HAS a price, and the
 * stated amount is short, the request is closed `failed` with the two figures
 * on it and the refusal is PAYMENT_SHORT. Nothing is staged and no pull is
 * ordered. Precisely three things are NOT refused, on purpose:
 *
 *   * an UNKNOWN amount (null) — that is the quote fallback above, unchanged.
 *     NULL MEANS UNKNOWN and unknown must not become an accusation.
 *   * an OVERpayment — the client is not short, so the work runs. A human
 *     handles the difference; refusing would be a worse answer than doing it.
 *   * a row with price_total_cents NULL — nothing to compare against, so there
 *     is no shortfall to assert. 331 refuses a 0 price, so a priced row is
 *     always > 0 and a real comparison.
 *
 * The money is NOT lost by refusing. paid_at, amount_paid_cents and payment_ref
 * are all written onto the failed row, so the sum that did arrive is on the
 * record for whoever refunds or chases it. `failed` is a finished state, so it
 * holds no slot in uq_paid_service_requests_one_open (345) and the client is
 * not locked out of buying again.

 * stageRound — order the fresh report and put the round on a human's board.
 *
 * THE MAILING INVARIANT LIVES HERE. `staged` means, precisely:
 *   * a soft_pull_requests row exists, so a fresh report is on order;
 *   * the request is on the open board a staff member works from;
 *   * NOTHING HAS BEEN MAILED, and this function cannot mail anything. It
 *     imports no mail function and emits no event a mailer listens for.
 *
 * The letters do not exist yet at this point and cannot: they are built from
 * the pull that has just been ordered. A human presses send in the existing
 * screen once it lands. src/metro2/delivery/send.mjs:3 and api/repair/send.mjs:3
 * both forbid mailing from payment.received and nothing here routes around it.
 *
 * THE PULL CAN REFUSE. requestSoftPull() reads consent at request time, every
 * time, and throws when it is missing or revoked. That is the `pull_failed`
 * refusal: the money is already taken, so the request is marked `failed` with
 * the reason on the row, and a human has a visible thing to fix. It is NOT
 * swallowed and it does NOT leave the row sitting at `paid` looking healthy.
