// Rounds 4 and 5 — the two regulator complaints — in three states.
//
// OWNER-SET 2026-09-05. "A simple ping." Rounds 4 and 5 each carry exactly three
// states and no more:
//
//   prepared   we built the form
//   sent       it left us on this date, which the send path already knows
//   filed      the CLIENT told us they filed it, ideally with a case number
//
// SENT IS NOT FILED, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS FILE.
//
// Round 4 is a CFPB complaint and Round 5 is a state attorney general complaint.
// What makes either one a FILING is the client's own signature on a declaration
// made under penalty of perjury (src/metro2/letters/catalog.mjs:57-65). Putting
// the envelope in the post is a thing this system can know and does record;
// whether the complaint was actually filed is a thing it cannot know unless
// somebody is told. So `sent` is read off the letter row and `filed` is read
// only off a report the client made, and the payload names who said so.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `filed` IS ALWAYS false IN THE SHIPPED SYSTEM TODAY. NOTHING WRITES IT.
//
// The ping that lets a client say "I filed it" is wave 4 and is not in this
// branch. The field is in the shape now so the front-end lane can build the
// state it will need, and it is wired to a real read so that it starts
// answering the moment something writes the value — but as of this commit
// nothing in this repository writes it, and the endpoint therefore returns
// `filed: false` for every client that exists. That is stated in the branch's
// contractDeviations and it was verified by grep, not assumed.
//
// WHERE `filed` IS READ FROM. `clients.custom_fields.escalation_filings`, which
// is this repository's existing extension point for exactly this kind of field —
// `cf_funding_advisor_user_id` and `referral_affiliate_id` are read the same way
// by api/read/portal-summary.mjs and by src/progress/read.mjs. No migration, no
// new table, and nothing for wave 4 to unpick if it chooses a real column
// instead: it changes one function in this file.
//
//   custom_fields.escalation_filings = {
//     "R4": { "filedAt": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z", "reportedBy": "client",
//             "caseNumber": "250401-1234567" }
//   }
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A ROUND WITH NO LETTER ROW IS NOT IN THE LIST AT ALL.
//
// Not "prepared: false", not a placeholder. A client who has never reached R4
// has no R4 entry, which is a different thing from a client whose R4 complaint
// was built and not yet posted. The screen can tell those two apart.
