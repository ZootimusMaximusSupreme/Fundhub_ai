// The score panels behind GET /api/read/client-progress.
//
// OWNER-SET, 2026-09-05: three personal bureaus PLUS business credit, and the
// business side is an ARRAY with one entry per business, because the panel
// TOGGLES between businesses. A single blended number is the wrong answer and
// businessCredit() in src/http/client-detail.mjs gives exactly that — it reads
// `businesses[0]` and throws the rest away. That function is right for the staff
// detail screen it was written for and wrong here, so this file does the
// per-business version instead of widening it.
//
// NULL MEANS NOT PULLED (CLAUDE.md §12). A bureau with no score is `null`, never
// 0 and never "". The front end renders that as "not pulled yet". A zero here
// would read to a client as a catastrophic score, which is the exact failure the
// rule exists to prevent.
//
// NOTHING IS INVENTED. Every number comes from a stored row:
//   personal → crs_results.result, read through triMerge() so the FICO range
//              check, the score-model check and the sandbox-fixture exclusion
//              are the same ones the staff screens already apply.
//   business → businesses.entity_data only, applied per row instead of to the
//              first row only.
//
// THE BUSINESS KEY LIST IS NARROWER THAN businessCredit()'s, ON PURPOSE, AND
// THAT IS A REAL DIFFERENCE WORTH KNOWING. src/http/client-detail.mjs:313-316
// reads FIVE candidates — scores.intelliscore, entity.intelliscore,
// commercialScore.score, then clients.custom_fields.biz_intelliscore and
// custom_fields.intelliscore — and also surfaces an FSR at :317. This file reads
// the first THREE and no FSR, because the last two live on the CLIENT row rather
// than the business row and there is no honest way to attribute one client-level
// number to one of several businesses on a page whose whole point is that the
// panel toggles between them. So if a number is ever stored in custom_fields it
// will show on the staff detail screen and read "not pulled" here.
//
// That is latent, not live: grep of src/, api/, db/ and public/ finds NO writer
// for any of the five keys or for the FSR — every hit is a reader. Nothing in
// this repository has ever stored a business credit score, so today every
// business panel returns `score: null`. Measured 2026-09-05, not assumed.

 * as null. That is right for a tri-merge — you want the three from one moment —
 * and wrong for a panel, where the honest answer is "651, pulled 12 January"
 * rather than "not pulled". Each bureau therefore walks the rows newest-first
 * and stops at its own first real number, and `pulledAt` says which pull that
 * was, so a stale panel is visibly stale instead of silently current.
 *
 * KNOWN MISMATCH, DISCLOSED RATHER THAN PAPERED OVER. `reportDocumentId` is the
 * NEWEST credit report on file, whichever pull the panel's own number came from.
 * So a January TransUnion panel can link to the March report, and the March
 * report may have no TransUnion score in it. The panel's date is still honest —
 * it says January — but the document behind it is not the document that number
 * was read from. Fixing this properly needs a link from a report document back
 * to the crs_results row it was generated from, and no such column exists.
 * Guessing one by matching timestamps would be worse. Left as is, on the record.

 * NOT the name: F44 in the 2026-09-03 walkthrough was a business fact that never
 * reached the engine, and an ordinal key would break the toggle the first time a
 * second business was added ahead of the first in the sort.
 *
 * A client with no business row gets an EMPTY ARRAY, not a placeholder panel.
 * There is no business to score, which is a different thing from a business
 * whose score has not been pulled — and that second case is the one that gets a
 * panel with `score: null`.
 *
 * `pulledAt` IS ALWAYS null, AND THAT IS THE FIX, NOT THE GAP.
 *
 * It used to be `businesses.updated_at`. That column is maintained by a database
 * trigger (trg_businesses_updated) on EVERY update to the row, so editing the
 * business address — or its name, or its age — silently repainted the client's
 * business score as freshly pulled. A date we do not have is null. It is never a
 * nearby timestamp that looks like one, and `created_at` is no better: it is
 * when the row was inserted, which is not when anybody pulled a score either.
 *
 * `businesses` has no per-score timestamp anywhere: id, org_id, client_id, name,
 * age_months, entity_data, created_at, updated_at, and nothing inside
 * entity_data (api/soft-pull-approve.mjs:241-260 writes the whole object and
 * stores no pull date). Verified against the real table, 2026-09-05. Until a
 * per-business pull timestamp exists, this stays null and the screen says
 * "date unknown" rather than a date that is wrong.
