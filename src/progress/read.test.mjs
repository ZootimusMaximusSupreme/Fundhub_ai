/* ── HOLE N13, 2026-09-18 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Live, Sim Twelve-Academy (f01cc0e0) held a live funding-snapshot grant from
   15:13 UTC with no Funding Snapshot saved, had signed its Funding Agreement,
   had paid twice, and had a funding round started at 15:13. /progress.html said
   "Your documents appear here once they are ready." and "Nothing has happened
   on your file yet." — both empty, because the read never looked at grants or
   at the milestone events.

   The fake database below answers with #12's own live shape (names and times
   only): two live grants (the snapshot and the course) and one lapsed one, no
   deliverable documents, and #12's real event names — the milestones among the
   internal ones. Every other read answers empty. */
