// The client-facing progress timeline, and the one thing it may never say.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// R4 AND R5 MUST NEVER APPEAR AS FILED
//
// Round 4 is the CFPB complaint and Round 5 is the state attorney general
// complaint. Whoever puts them in the post, the thing that makes them a FILING
// is the client's own hand-signed declaration under penalty of perjury, and
// nothing in this repository ever hears that it happened
// (src/metro2/letters/catalog.mjs:57-65 states this outright). So a line reading
// "CFPB complaint filed" would be this system asserting, on a screen the client
// reads, a fact it does not have and cannot get.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY THIS IS AN ALLOWLIST AND NOT A FILTER
//
// The first version of this file was a DENYLIST: render whatever machine name
// somebody stored, then rewrite the line if it matched a regulator word AND a
// submission verb. It did not hold. The verb list omitted the bare verbs
// "sent", "mailed", "delivered" and "posted", and "mailed" is this repository's
// own live decision vocabulary — so "cfpb complaint mailed" went straight to a
// client's screen untouched. A denylist can never be finished, because the
// thing it has to catch is a string nobody has written yet.
//
// So the shape is inverted. This module does not filter a rendered line; it
// CHOOSES the line. A decision name is looked up in TIMELINE_WORDS below and the
// words that come back are the only words emitted. A decision name that is not
// in the map — including every decision name that will be invented after this
// file is written — renders as NEUTRAL_WORDS and carries no claim at all.
//
// Two layers, because the map itself can also be edited badly:
//
//   1. STRUCTURAL. Only a value from TIMELINE_WORDS is ever rendered. A new
//      decision string cannot leak a phrase by not being on a list, because not
//      being on the list is what makes it neutral.
//   2. THE MAP IS SCRUBBED AT LOAD. Every phrase is put through claimsFiled()
//      when this module is imported and any phrase that asserts a regulator
//      filing is DROPPED, so it renders as neutral too. Adding
//      "cfpb complaint filed" to the map below does not ship it.
//
// timeline.test.mjs fails if either layer stops.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THE TIMELINE DOES NOT CARRY
//
// The timeline says nothing about a regulator complaint in either direction —
// not prepared, not sent, not filed. `repair_decision_log` rows do not reliably
// carry which round they belong to, so a timeline line cannot tell an R4
// complaint apart from an R2 bureau letter, and guessing is how a false sentence
// gets on a screen. The three escalation states live in their own field of the
// payload, built from the letter rows themselves — see src/progress/escalations.mjs.
//
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHERE THE WORDS COME FROM
//
// repair_decision_log, via TIMELINE_SQL and timelineLine()
// (src/repair/lens.mjs:206) — both already written, both working, both
// staff-only until now. gatherRepairDetailSignals() is the function that pairs
// them and it is called rather than re-implemented.
//
// timelineLine() is still the renderer, and it still puts the date on the front.
// It is handed the APPROVED WORDS in place of the stored decision name, so the
// stored name never reaches it. That is deliberate: the date formatting stays in
// one place and the raw machine name has no path to the screen.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

 *
 * Live look 2026-09-18, hole N13: Sim Twelve-Academy (f01cc0e0) signed its
 * Funding Agreement on 17 Sep, paid twice, and had a funding round started at
 * 15:13 UTC on 18 Sep. This page said "Nothing has happened on your file yet."
 * The timeline read ONLY repair_decision_log, and a funding file never writes a
 * row there — so every funding client was told nothing had happened, whatever
 * had.
 *
 * Those milestones are already recorded, with their real times, as canonical
 * events (src/events/canonical.mjs):
 *   payment.received   src/adapters/commas.mjs — every successful payment
 *   contract.signed    src/contracts/sign.mjs — the client signed
 *   round.*            src/funding/card-stacking-rounds.mjs STAGE_TO_EVENT and
 *                      src/adapters/lendflow.mjs — the funding round's steps
 *
 * SAME ALLOWLIST DESIGN, ONE DIFFERENCE. The events table carries every internal
 * event (message.queued, entry.captured, inquiry.gate.raised and the rest), so a
 * name that is not on this list is not SELECTED at all — it never becomes a
 * neutral "progress update" line. Only the names below can reach the screen, and
 * their words go through the same allowlistFrom() scrub as the list above. No
 * amount, product, lender name or payload field is ever read, let alone printed.
 *
 * deposit.paid is deliberately NOT here: it fires for the same money as
 * payment.received, and listing both would show one payment twice.
 *
 * No phrase below may use a filing word ("submitted" included) — the timeline
 * is held to that by src/http/client-progress.pg.test.mjs.
