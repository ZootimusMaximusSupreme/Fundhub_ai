/* Real Postgres: a Card Stacking round goes funded and the client gets a BILL.
   Not a task. A bill.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. F-07 refused to invoice unless the round.funded event
   carried a fee percent, and nothing ever put one there — so every funded round
   in this system's life produced the task "Fix fee lock/percent before
   invoicing" and no invoice at all. Both existing test files were green
   throughout: the emitter's test never ran F-07, and F-07's own test handed
   itself a feePercent no real event carried.

   So this drives the real chain end to end against a real database:
       moveCardToStage → round.funded → money-chain closeout → F-07 invoice
   and asserts the money, the refusals, and that the closeout record and the
   invoice agree on the same basis.

   Basis: CONFIRMED APPROVALS (owner-set 2026-08-30, docs/CLOSEOUT-FEE-BASIS.md). */
