// The affiliate's share of the 10% success fee, end to end. SKIPS without DATABASE_URL.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE EXISTS TO PROVE. Three things, none of which were true before
// 2026-08-31:
//
//   1. convert() is REACHED FROM A REAL PAYMENT EVENT. It has been exported and
//      correct since 033 and no production file ever called it, so an affiliate
//      could be attributed to a client for months and earn nothing
//      (docs/specs/W1-money-model.md finding F1). Nothing in this file calls
//      convert() by hand — everything goes through emit() on the bus, exactly the
//      way a Commas webhook arrives.
//
//   2. THE MONEY SPLITS THE WAY THE OWNER SET IT (docs/specs/W0-decisions.md).
//      On a $120,000 funded deal the 10% fee is $12,000, of which $3,000 was the
//      deposit and $9,000 is the invoiced balance:
//
//          fundhub half             $6,000   ← never moves
//          partner half             $6,000
//            tier 1 affiliate 20%  -$1,200
//            tier 2 affiliate  5%    -$300
//          partner net              $4,500
//
//      The affiliates are paid out of the PARTNER'S half, so fundhub's $6,000 is
//      identical whether the partner has no affiliates or five.
//
//   3. A RE-DELIVERED PAYMENT PAYS ONCE. Commas re-sends. The conversion is
//      guarded on status = 'attributed', so the second and third delivery report
//      "already_converted" and the commission does not move.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED: fee/commission timing and the basis money is split on.
