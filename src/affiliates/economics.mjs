// Affiliate economics — attribution, accrual, and tier unlocking.
//
// 033_affiliates.sql models the affiliate and the referral; it does not decide
// when money is earned. This is that decision, and only that: no migration, no
// new table, no rate written in code.
//
// FOUR RULES, and where each one actually lives.
//
// 1. FIRST TOUCH IS IMMUTABLE. Enforced by the database, not here: the unique
//    index affiliate_referrals_client_tier_uniq means one direct owner and one
//    downline owner per client, forever, and every write uses ON CONFLICT DO
//    NOTHING. That single statement is both replay-idempotent and incapable of
//    stealing an existing attribution. attribute() below relies on that rather
//    than checking first and inserting second, because a check-then-insert has a
//    race and this is somebody's commission.
//
// 2. ACCRUAL ON QUALIFIED COMPLETED OUTCOMES ONLY. Not on a payment, not on a
//    signup — on an outcome that actually completed:
//      a funded engagement          (funding_rounds.funded_amount > 0)
//      a completed repair enrolment (a paid repair product on the sale)
//    A deposit is not an outcome. Idempotent per source event.
//
// 3. TIER 2 UNLOCKS on the FIRST funded referral OR the FIRST recruited
//    affiliate, whichever happens first, and unlocking is one-way. Once unlocked,
//    the recruiter earns a downline override on their recruits' conversions.
//
// 4. RATES ARE ROWS. Every amount comes from affiliate_commission_rules.
//    Owner-set 2026-08-24 (migrations 260–261): Tier 1 direct 20%, Tier 2 downline 5%.
//    Owner-set 2026-08-31 (migration 272): on FUNDING those same two rates now
//    apply to the partner's half of every non-refund payment on the sale, so an
//    affiliate earns on the 10% success fee and not only on the deposit. Rates
//    are versioned — 272 closes the deposit-basis rows and opens new ones; it
//    never UPDATEs a live percent.
//    This module still does not hardcode those numbers — it reads the rows.
//    With no rule in force, commission_due stays NULL, the balance stays zero and
//    nothing pays. `unrated` in the return value is how that stays visible rather
//    than looking like a zero-value conversion.
//
// WHERE THIS IS CALLED FROM. attribute() runs on the referral-capture workflow
// (src/workflows/af-02-referral-ownership-capture.mjs). convertSafe() runs from
// ensureSalePayment() in src/handlers/money-chain.mjs — the one place a
// sale_payments row is written, which is the one durable moment money is known to
// have arrived. Until 2026-08-31 nothing in production called convert() at all
// and no affiliate commission was ever accrued (W1-money-model.md finding F1).

// Which products count as which kind of completed outcome. Product CODES, matched
// against products.code, because routing on a dollar amount is how a price change
// silently re-routes an outcome.

   'partner_share_of_cash' to the amount_basis enum, so this is the code change
   033's note says an enum value costs.

   WHAT IT IS. Every non-refund payment on the sale — the funding deposit AND the
   10% success fee that lands months later — multiplied by the partner's own
   revenue_share_pct. Owner-set 2026-08-31 (docs/specs/W0-decisions.md, "Affiliates
   earn on the back end"): a sub-affiliate is paid out of the PARTNER'S half, so
   the partner's half is what their rate applies to, and fundhub's 50% cannot move
   however many people sit under the partner:

     $12,000 collected → partner half $6,000 → tier 1 20% = $1,200
                                             → tier 2  5% =   $300
     fundhub keeps $6,000, every time.

   WHEN THERE IS NO PARTNER. A fundhub-direct client has no partner half to take
   from — fundhub owns the whole of that cash and pays its own affiliate out of
   it — so the basis is the cash in full. That is a real change for the direct
   book: the schedule used to pay on the deposit alone and now pays on everything
   collected, which is exactly the owner decision, applied to everyone.

   WHEN THE PARTNER CANNOT BE READ. A client naming a partner this query cannot
   reach (deleted, or another org) is UNKNOWN, and unknown is null — never zero
   and never the undiluted cash. convert() leaves commission_due NULL, and
   unratedConversions() lists it.

   KNOWN LIMIT, RECORDED NOT HIDDEN. A referral converts ONCE (033's design: one
   status flip, one frozen rule_snapshot, scope_rule 'first_paid_product'), so
   this basis is whatever had been collected at that moment. A success fee paid
   in one go is the whole fee and the affiliate is paid on all of it. A success
   fee paid in three instalments converts on the first one, and the two after it
   do not raise the commission — the partner accrues 50% of each instalment, the
   affiliate does not. Making the affiliate follow every instalment means
   re-opening a converted referral, which is the one thing the frozen snapshot
   exists to prevent, so it is an owner decision and not a code fix. */
