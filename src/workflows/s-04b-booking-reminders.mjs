// S-04B — Booking confirmation + reminders.
// Source: the CRM S-04B (confirm / T-24h / T-2h). Owner 2026-08-15: port SMS leg
// only — no video links. Stops if the call is already held before a reminder.
// Owner 2026-08-22: S-04B also owns the single immediate booking-confirm EMAIL
// (the CRM S-04 "Appointment Confirmation"), written fresh — the old copy was
// Analyzer-era and was never wired.
//
// Trigger: booking.created. Spec 4.10: booking.rescheduled cancels the in-flight
// run and restarts against the new start_time (same content).

   * answer, and then starts again from the top — replaying the steps it already
   * has and re-running everything OUTSIDE a step against whatever the clock says

   *
   * So a plan computed out here was recomputed on every wake. When the run woke
   * at "24 hours before the call", it asked "is 24 hours before the call still
   * in the future?", answered no — it is this instant — and took the
   * booked_inside_24h branch instead of sending. The same thing happened again
   * at the 2-hour mark. Both reminders were silently switched off, which is why
   * this is inside a step now: a step's answer is recorded on the first pass and
   * handed back unchanged on every replay, so these are the moments chosen at
   * booking time and they do not move. Same shape as the memoized wake time in
   * src/workflows/ai-set-01-josh-setter.mjs.
   *
