// Sweeper — fire AI bureau calls when call_due_at elapses.
//
// SERVED SINCE 2026-08-19, owner decision. It was previously switched off by
// being left out of src/workflows/index.mjs, which nothing counted and no
// screen showed — see src/workflows/index.test.mjs, which now fails if a
// workflow on disk is neither served nor explicitly listed as unserved.
//
// This places real outbound calls every 15 minutes. The gate that remains is
// call_due_at: fireDueCalls only touches rows whose wait has elapsed.
