// AF-02 — Referral Ownership Capture.
// Source: GHL workflow 0c561c0b-6216-4068-844d-35f307285ca6 (ghl-crm-source-of-truth.md).
//
// Original triggers were "Tag Added: lead:new / analyzer:started / analyzer:complete"
// — all three map cleanly onto canonical events already in canonical.mjs:
// lead:new -> entry.captured, analyzer:started -> diagnostic.paid (the $32 analyzer
// pull payment), analyzer:complete -> analysis.completed. No new event needed.
//
// This one operates entirely on the LEAD's own client record (clients.custom_fields)
// — "Affiliate Tier1/Tier2 Owner" here just means "which affiliate referred this
// lead", captured from inbound referral params (a1/a2) on the triggering event's
// payload. Sticky: only ever set once, never overwritten (GHL's own rule) — enforced
// by gating on the field currently being empty before writing.
//
// Unlike AF-01/03A/03B/04/05 (BLOCKED — see workflow-migration-table.md), this one
// doesn't need the affiliate's own tier/tracking-id record, so the missing
// affiliate data model doesn't block it.
