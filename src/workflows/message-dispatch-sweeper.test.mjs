// Tests for the message dispatch sweeper.

  /* THIS BLOCK USED TO ASSERT THE SWEEPER WAS NOT REGISTERED, and said in
     capitals not to "fix" it by adding the export. That guard was right for the
     product it was written in and it is what shipped: twenty-six workflows
     queued client email and nothing ever drained it, invisibly, forever.

     The owner asked for that to end ("holy shit, we gotta send out emails…
     it should be an option, the ability to set it up"), so the gate MOVED
     rather than being deleted. It is now a per-company row —
     messaging_settings.outbound_enabled (119) — which is visible in the CRM,
     changeable by an owner, attributed, and per tenant. An env var was none of
     those things.

     These tests guard the gate that replaced it. If sending ever stops being
     refusable per company, or the drain ever reaches a provider without going
     through the gate, this is what should go red. */
