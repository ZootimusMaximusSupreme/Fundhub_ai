// BC-01 — Customer Responsiveness Classifier.
// Source: the CRM system map BEHAVIORAL COMPLIANCE section.
// Writes to behavior_scores.responsiveness (numeric) — the schema's nightly-scoring
// column already anticipated this. The CRM's categorical Fast/Normal/Slow is mapped to
// 1.0/0.5/0.0 (decision logged in workflow-migration-table.md — the schema column is
// numeric, the CRM's was a select field).
//
// Trigger: round.started. Checks docs-missing clearance (crs_paid, or docs:missing
// no longer tagged) at 24h and 48h waits, same wait ladder as the original.

// pays the CRS diagnostic, so that short-circuit returned true for all of them and the
