// AT-01 — First Touch Capture.
// Source: GHL-System-Map.md ATTRIBUTION WORKFLOWS section.
// AT-02 (Attribution Normalizer) is a defensive re-check of the same "don't
// overwrite First Touch Date once set" rule this file already enforces via its own
// gate — merged in rather than built as a separate file (see workflow-migration-table.md).
// The other "S-02 — Attribution Capture" entry in the map sets the exact same field
// for the exact same reason — also merged in here, not built separately.
//
// Trigger: entry.captured. Sticky: only ever set once (gate on currently empty).
