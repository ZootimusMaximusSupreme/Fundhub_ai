/* hasBooked — has this person booked a call yet?
 *
 * THE OLD VERSION COULD ONLY EVER SAY NO. It asked for booking events
 * `WHERE client_id = $1`, and until 2026-09-03 the ClickFunnels adapter wrote
 * every funnel event with client_id NULL. So the chase never learned that
 * anybody had booked, and on 2026-09-03 one phone received 51 copies of "you
 * have not booked yet" from customers who were sitting in the Booked column.
 *
 * The adapter now stamps the client on new events. This is the other half:
 * every booking event ALREADY IN THE DATABASE still has a null client on it,
 * and every chase run sleeping in production is going to wake against those
 * rows. So the booking is also matched on the email address and the phone
 * number carried in the event's own payload — which is how a run that went to
 * sleep last night exits on wake instead of firing again.
 *
 * Scoped to the client's own company. The old query was not, and matching on an
 * email address without that scope would let one company's booking answer for
 * another's. Phone numbers are compared on their last ten digits so
 * "+1 555-000-1111" and "5550001111" are the same number.
