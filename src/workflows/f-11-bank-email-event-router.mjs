// F-11 — Bank Email Event Router (Inbound).
// Source: GHL workflow f4a6d38d-7717-4f3c-96f6-84c81e885022 (ghl-crm-source-of-truth.md).
// Spec §4 adapter note: "Mailgun adapter: unchanged inbox classification, now writing
// bank_inbox + events directly (F-11 becomes a handler)" — this file IS that handler.
// src/handlers/comms.mjs's onMailResponse already writes the bank_inbox row; this
// adds the task-routing + APPROVED/COUNTEROFFER stage move on the same event.
//
// Trigger: mail.response (exact canonical match). Routes on payload.classification.
// DENIED gets its own deeper follow-through in f-09-funding-declined-no-path.mjs;
// MISSING_DOCS gets its own deeper follow-through in
// f-06-funding-conditions-missing-docs.mjs. This file's job is strictly the routing
// task GHL created for every classification (APPROVAL/COUNTER/DOCS
// NEEDED/DENIED/ACTION REQUIRED/APP RECEIVED) — one task title per classification,
// deduped by event id like every other task in this directory.
