/* The saved next step is the screen's step (hole 12, round 3, 2026-09-18).

 * Live on 2026-09-18: #8's panel said "Remove Inquiries" while its saved step
 * said "Pull CRS" — S-06 fired on a late deposit at 15:18 and saved its fixed
 * word over the top. Every job that saves employee_next_action goes through
 * mergeCustomFields, so that is where the fixed word is replaced.
