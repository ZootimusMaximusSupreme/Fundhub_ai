// The message dispatch sweeper — the thing that calls the dispatcher on a
// schedule.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// IT IS NOW REGISTERED. WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY — 2026-08-02
//
// This file used to open by explaining at length that it was deliberately NOT in
// src/workflows/index.mjs, so that outbound sending could not start without the
// owner's say-so. That reasoning was right for the state of the product it was
// written in, and it is what shipped: twenty-six workflows queued client email
// and NOTHING EVER DRAINED IT. Every message this platform ever composed sat in
// a table, invisibly, forever.
//
// The owner's instruction, verbatim: "holy shit, we gotta send out emails.
// Right? That's kind of like an obvious… it's not like the workflow is something
// that we turn on… it should be an option, the ability to set it up."
//
// So the gate moved rather than disappearing. It is no longer "this function is
// not registered"; it is db/migrations/126_outbound_switch.sql —
// messaging_settings.outbound_enabled, PER COMPANY, visible in the CRM,
// changeable by an owner, and attributed to whoever changed it. Every one of
// those is a property an env var did not have.
//
// WHAT STILL PROTECTS AGAINST AN ACCIDENT, all of it unchanged:
//   * src/messaging/outbox.mjs drain() refuses when the switch is off, and
//     enforces a per-company daily cap so a looping workflow mails 500 people
//     and stops rather than 50,000.
//   * The compliance gate runs on every single message inside dispatch.mjs, in
//     the order gate → route → send, with no override and no bypass.
//   * With no provider credentials nothing leaves whatever any flag says. That
//     is the real control and always was.
//
// So this switch is a PAUSE BUTTON, not an ignition key. Registering the
// function does not itself send anything either: Inngest invokes nothing until
// INNGEST_EVENT_KEY is set, which remains the owner's to set. Until then the
// same drain runs from the CRM's Outbox screen and from
// POST /api/messages-outbound { action: "dispatch" }.
//
//
// WHY A SWEEPER AND NOT AN EVENT HANDLER.
//
// Reacting to message.queued would dispatch each message the instant it was
// written, which sounds better and is worse:
//
//   * A message with a future scheduled_at is not due yet, so most of those
//     reactions would have nothing to do.
//   * A text deferred overnight has no new event to wake it. Something has to
//     come back and look.
//   * A retryable provider failure is the same shape — the message goes back on
//     the queue with no event attached to it.
//
// A backlog that drains on a clock handles all three with one mechanism. This is
// the one place in this repo where polling is the right answer rather than the
// lazy one: n-06's header explains why a nightly scan is the wrong port of a GHL
// workflow trigger, and that reasoning is about business rules firing on a
// timer, not about a delivery queue draining.
//
//
// EVERY PASS IS BOUNDED. One pass claims at most DEFAULT_BATCH messages and
// dispatches them one at a time. It does not loop until the queue is empty: an
// unbounded drain holds a function open for as long as the backlog is long, and
// a backlog that cannot be worked through in one pass is worked through in the
// next one. Nothing is lost by stopping early — an unclaimed message is still
// queued and still due.
//
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// F1 — WHERE THE THREE MINUTES ACTUALLY GO. MEASURED, 2026-09-03.
//
// The owner booked five simulated calls on the live site and the confirmation
// text, email and AI call all landed roughly three minutes later against a
// 60-second target. Measured against the production database afterwards, on
// the real `events` and `messages` rows from that walk (all times UTC):
//
//   booking → the row is QUEUED           44s, 69s, 188s  (three bookings)
//   queued  → the dispatcher first tries  46s to 270s
//
// Worked example, the last sim client of the walk:
//   01:07:58  booking.created written
//   01:11:06  SMS-S04-01-CONFIRM queued   (188s after the booking)
//   01:12:01  EMAIL-S04-01-CONFIRM queued (243s)
//   01:15:35  first dispatch attempt on both — 7m37s after the booking.
//
// So it is TWO delays, not one, and neither is small:
//
//   1. THIS SWEEPER'S CADENCE, and it is the half this file owns. Every
//      templated message waits for the next pass. Worst case is one whole
//      cron interval — five minutes — and the measured waits (46s…270s) are
//      exactly the spread you get from arriving at a random point in a
//      five-minute cycle. A 60-second target cannot be met by a five-minute
//      clock, whatever else is fixed.
//
//   2. WORKFLOW-SIDE LATENCY BEFORE THE ROW EXISTS — s-04b-booking-reminders
//      resolves the client, queues the text, mints a portal link, then queues
//      the email, and each of those is a separate Inngest step round trip.
//      That cost 44s for the first sim client of the walk and 188s for the
//      fifth, i.e. it grows under load. NOT this file's to fix; recorded here
//      because halving the sweep interval alone would still miss the target.
//
// The single-message path that answers (1) is outbox.drainMessageNow(). The
// cadence below is unchanged pending the owner's call — see that function.
