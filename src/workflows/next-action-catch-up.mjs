// The next-step catch-up — every five minutes, the saved step is put back in
// line with the step the Client Control Panel shows.
//
// Hole 12, round 3, 2026-09-18. Measured live that afternoon: all six files
// holding a saved step (clients.custom_fields.employee_next_action) disagreed
// with the control panel — #8 saved "Pull CRS" while the panel said "Remove
// Inquiries"; #11, #12, Combo and Walk4 saved "Pull CRS" or "Collect
// Documents" while the panel said "Apply for Funding".
//
// Two causes, two halves of the fix:
//   1. A dozen jobs each saved their own fixed word. mergeCustomFields
//      (src/workflows/custom-fields.mjs) now saves the panel's step instead.
//   2. The panel's step also moves with NO save at all — a funding card moved
//      on the board, an inquiry case opened or closed, a credit report landed,
//      written permission recorded, a staff drag — and some jobs change the
//      step right after they save (C-05, S-DOC, F-11). Nothing wakes up for
//      those. This pass does: it works the step out again for every file that
//      has a saved one and saves it only when it differs.
//
// WHAT IT TOUCHES: one key, employee_next_action, on files that already have
// one. Nothing else on the record, and never a file without a saved step.
// The write only lands if the saved words are still the ones this pass read,
// so a job that saved in between is never overwritten with an older answer.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER DOES: send, queue a message, emit an event, create a task, or
// move a card. It reads, and it writes that one key. The only trigger on
// `clients` (set_updated_at, measured live) stamps updated_at and nothing else.
//
// IT NEVER SAVES A BLANK. When the panel's step cannot be worked out — a read
// failed, the answer came back degraded, or no step applies — the saved words
// are left exactly as they are.
//
// BOUNDED. One pass looks at CATCH_UP_BATCH files at most. With more files than
// that, each pass takes the next page (by the five-minute slot), so every file
// is looked at within ceil(files / CATCH_UP_BATCH) passes. Six files live today.
//
// NEVER THROWS. The next pass is the recovery.
