// sendTemplated — shared send helper for workflow functions (Section 7 messaging
// engine + Rule 9 idempotency).
//
// Never invents copy: if `templateKey` has no row in message_templates, or the row
// hasn't passed the compliance gate, the send is a safe no-op ({ sent: false,
// reason: "template_pending" }). Real N-series SMS content is confirmed missing in
// GHL itself (Chris's own tracking note) — this is how that gap surfaces instead of
// silently sending blank/placeholder messages.
//
// Idempotent via the existing messages_org_providerref_uniq index (migration 004):
// provider_ref is synthesized from the triggering event's id, so a replayed event
// can't double-send even though this isn't a real external provider callback.
//
// STAFF TELEMETRY IS A SEAM HERE, AND IT IS EMPTY ON PURPOSE.
// `staff_events` records "this person did this thing". Every one of this
// function's 39 call sites is an Inngest workflow reacting to a system event,
// and a workflow has no staff member — so there is nobody to attribute a
// `text_sent` row to and none is written. The `staffId` argument below is the
// place a staff-initiated send would pass one; there is no such send today (no
// api/messages.mjs, no send action on any endpoint), so it is never supplied
// and no row is ever produced. That is the correct outcome, not a gap to fill
// with an invented actor. See src/shifts/TELEMETRY-CALLSITES.md.
