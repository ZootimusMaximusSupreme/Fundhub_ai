// repair-enrollment — the paid-for repair program actually starts itself.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, measured on production 2026-09-06.
//
//   Walk3 Trial ($200, repair-trial):  repair.enrolled -> repair.docs.needed ->
//                                      message.queued -> welcome email delivered
//   Walk2 Full  ($1,000, repair-bundle): payment.received. Then nothing.
//
// The obvious reading is that the trial product auto-enrols and the full one
// does not. IT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED. Walk3's repair.enrolled row is stamped
// 11:11:44 and its payment.received 12:50:11 — the enrolment came an hour and a
// half BEFORE the money. Somebody pressed the Enrol button by hand. Nothing in
// this codebase has ever enrolled anybody on a payment: not for the trial, not
// for the bundle. Walk2 is not a product-specific bug, it is every repair buyer
// who nobody happened to click, and the click is only available on a screen
// that lists clients who are already enrolled.
//
// So this module is the missing automatic enrolment, hung off the payment the
// way funding hangs off round.started. src/handlers/purchase-routing.mjs is
// already registered on deposit.paid / sale.closed / payment.received and
// already works out that the client bought repair, so it calls this last.
//
// HOW MANY ROUNDS. From the product, never from the button. The CRM's Enrol
// control hardcodes program "trial" at $200, which caps rounds_cap at 2 — press
// it for a client who bought the six-round bundle and rounds 3 to 6 are refused
// later, long after anyone remembers why. Here the trial is the named
// exception and everything else in the repair category is the full six-round
// program, so a repair product added tomorrow gets the full course rather than
// silently capping a paying client at two rounds.
//
// NEVER OVERWRITE A LIVE PROGRAM. enrollRepairProgram() upserts on
// (org_id, client_id) and would happily rewrite program, rounds_cap and the
// money on a client sitting mid-round-four. So this only ever enrols a client
// who has NO repair_programs row. An upgrade from the trial to the full bundle
// is therefore still a human decision — see the report; it is not something a
// late installment payment gets to do behind everyone's back.
//
// SAFE TO FIRE TWICE, like everything else on this path. Three payment events
// can route the same purchase and a webhook can be redelivered. The enrolment
// is skipped once a program row exists, and the tasks dedupe on their titles.
