// F-07 — Funding Locked (F22).
// Source: the CRM workflow 992e1734-3d5b-4d51-91cb-7b665650f407 (the CRM source-of-truth export).
// Audit fix applied: real ready-to-paste SMS + email-subject copy (the FR22 "Total
// Funding Locked" body from EMAIL-TEMPLATES-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md, grepped for this one
// key only), seeded via src/workflows/templates-seed.mjs.
//
// Trigger: round.funded (F22 "Funding Locked" is the funded-round terminal stage).
// Gate: a confirmed approved total AND an agreed fee percent. Both or neither.
//
// ── THE BUG THIS FILE CARRIED, AND WHAT IT COST ────────────────────────────
// This handler required `feePercent` on the event before it would invoice, and
// nothing ever put `feePercent` on the event. Card Stacking's emitter did not
// (src/funding/card-stacking-rounds.mjs) and neither did the Lendflow adapter.
// So EVERY funded round fell into the not-ready branch below: a tag, a task
// reading "Fix fee lock/percent before invoicing", and no invoice, no email, no
// SMS. No client has ever been billed automatically. The emitter now carries
// the fee percent, the confirmed approved total, and the sale/round ids.
//
// ── THE FEE BASIS — SETTLED (owner-set 2026-08-30) ─────────────────────────
// The old FLAG here asked whether `approvedAmount` was the funded base or the
// fee itself. It is the base, and the base is CONFIRMED APPROVALS. Chris:
// "Approved is correct... make sure we bill based on confirmed approvals."
//
//   feeAmount = confirmed approved total × agreed fee percent
//
// CRM's "Commission Owed" field copy is still not ported, and still should not
// be: it set Commission Owed = total_approved_amount with no multiplication
// anywhere in the crawl. Under this decision the formula is defined in
// src/funding/success-fee.mjs and nowhere else, and it is that module — not a
// field copy from a dead CRM — that both this workflow and the closeout record
// read. Logged in workflow-migration-table.md.
//
// A round with nothing confirmed, or a client whose sale agreed no rate, gets a
// NAMED REFUSAL and a task for a person. It never gets a $0 invoice.
//
// COMPLIANCE REVIEW REQUIRED: fee basis.

/**
 * What this round can be billed, and why not when it cannot.
 *
 * The event is the first source of truth: the emitter reads the confirmed
 * approvals and the agreed rate out of the database at the moment of funding
 * and freezes them on the event, so a replay bills the same amount it billed
 * the first time. When the event is missing either half — a rail that does not
 * carry them yet — the database answers, but only when the event names the
 * round. Nothing is ever guessed, and nothing is ever defaulted to zero.
