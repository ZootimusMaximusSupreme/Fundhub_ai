// The candidate follow-up cadence, on a clock.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHAT IT DOES
//
// Every half hour it looks for job applications whose next follow-up is due,
// and queues that step's email (and text, if the applicant ticked the box).
// Four touches over ten days, then it stops. It also stops the moment the
// candidate replies, books, opts out, or a human moves the application — the
// exits live in src/hiring/outreach.mjs and are re-read on every single pass,
// because this thing sleeps for days at a time and all four can become true
// while it is asleep.
//
// IT SENDS NOTHING ITSELF. It writes `messages` rows with status='queued' and
// stops. src/messaging/dispatch.mjs gates, routes and sends them, and
// message-dispatch-sweeper.mjs is what calls the dispatcher. So every control
// on outbound mail still applies to a candidate exactly as it applies to a
// client: the per-company pause switch, the daily cap, quiet hours on texts,
// restricted wording, and the compliance gate with no override.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// WHY A SWEEPER AND NOT AN EVENT WITH SLEEPS
//
// The obvious shape is one long-running function per applicant with
// step.sleep between touches. It is worse here for the same reason
// message-dispatch-sweeper.mjs gives:
//
//   * The exits have no events. Nobody emits "the candidate went quiet", and
//     three of the four stop conditions (a decision, a booking, an opt-out) are
//     rows changing rather than events firing. Something has to come back and
//     look.
//   * A cadence in flight would have to be cancelled when a human moves the
//     application, and a cancellation that misses leaves a workflow that texts
//     somebody after they were hired.
//   * Ten days is a long time to hold a function open for four small writes.
//
// A due-list drained on a clock handles all of it with one mechanism, and the
// state is a row anybody can read instead of a runtime somewhere.
//
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// EVERY PASS IS BOUNDED. SWEEP_CAP applications per pass, one step each. A
// backlog that does not fit in one pass is finished by the next one; an
// application that is still due is still due.
