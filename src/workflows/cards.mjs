// moveCardToStage — GHL's "Move Opportunity to Stage X" action, ported as a
// find-or-create against cards/pipelines/pipeline_stages (seeded in
// db/seed/002_pipelines.sql — pipeline/stage keys must match that seed exactly).
// Idempotent: find-or-create + a plain UPDATE, safe to run twice.

// Card Stacking (funding_card_stacking): after a successful move, emits the
// matching round.* event so money-chain + funding workflows fire. Funded moves
// are refused when funded_amount is missing/zero/negative, and also when any
// bank yes on the round still has no dollar amount against it — that approval
// would never be billed (CLOSEOUT-FEE-BASIS).
