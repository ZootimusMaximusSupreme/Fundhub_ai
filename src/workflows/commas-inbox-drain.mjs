/* The payment-queue drain, on the scheduler that is actually running.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — 2026-09-17.
 *
 * netlify/functions/commas-inbox-sweeper.mjs already does exactly this pass,
 * every minute, and its header explains why it was put on Netlify's cron
 * instead of Inngest. That reasoning is unchanged and that function stays
 * exactly as it is. The problem is not the code — it is the clock.
 *
 * MEASURED ON LIVE, 2026-09-17. Six commas_inbox rows sat status='pending'
 * with attempts=0, meaning nothing had even tried them. Two had been waiting
 * since 2026-09-15. The last time anything drained the queue was a single
 * 22-second burst at 17:46; nothing ran after it, across two deploys and four
 * hours. Meanwhile the Inngest clock was demonstrably alive in those same
 * hours, firing on a clean five-minute grid. So the Netlify cron is the dead
 * one, and the money path was hanging off it alone.
 *
 * netlify.toml:104-117 records this identical silent failure happening once
 * before, on 2026-09-06: a scheduled function that throws at load stops
 * running with no alarm, the queue rows just stay `pending`, and the deploy
 * that caused it is green. A single clock under the money path is the real
 * defect, and this is the second clock.
 *
 * RUNNING BOTH IS SAFE, which is why the Netlify one is left alone rather than
 * moved. claim() takes rows with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, so two passes that
 * overlap work different rows instead of the same ones or blocking; and the
 * inbox dedupes on the payment id before a row is ever written. A double pass
 * cannot count a payment twice.
 *
 * REGISTERING THIS SENDS NOTHING AND CHARGES NOTHING. It reads bytes Commas
 * already delivered and hands them to the same processor the Netlify function
 * hands them to. No money moves that has not already moved. */

 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY EVERY PASS SPEAKS — hole N6, measured on live 2026-09-18.
 *
 * This drain shipped at 23:14 UTC on 2026-09-17 and claimed nothing for the
 * next sixteen hours. Seven receipts sat pending, tried zero times, until the
 * Netlify sweeper was repaired at 15:13 UTC; all seven were claimed by that
 * one sweeper pass. The code here was not the fault. Inngest only runs the
 * functions it was told about the last time the app was synced with it
 * (PUT /api/inngest), and nothing synced after the deploy that added this
 * one. The api function's log shows it: overnight (03:00–03:10 UTC) the
 * five-minute jobs arrived on time, and whole minutes went by with no call
 * at all — a once-a-minute job Inngest knew about cannot leave that gap.
 * The re-sync at 18:47:52 UTC on 2026-09-18 registered it: from 19:49 to
 * 19:59 UTC the queue's claim ran 11 more times than the Netlify sweeper
 * accounts for — this drain, about once a minute. Any deploy that adds or
 * changes an Inngest function needs a sync after it, or Inngest never calls
 * the new one.
 *
 * It went unseen that long because a pass that found nothing said nothing, so
 * "running with an empty queue" and "never running" left the same empty log.
 * Now every pass leaves a line, and `netlify logs --function api` answers
 * "is the backup running?" on its own: a line a minute means yes, a gap means
 * Inngest is not calling it. `log` is an argument so the tests can read it. */
