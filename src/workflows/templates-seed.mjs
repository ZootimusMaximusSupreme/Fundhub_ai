// Known-real, audit-approved copy for message_templates — NOT auto-run anywhere
// (no boot file imports this). db/schema + db/seed/ are another session's territory
// (do not touch), so this stays as a plain, idempotent function in src/workflows/
// for whoever wires up the real seed step to call once against the live database.
//
// Unlike the N-series (where SMS is confirmed missing at the source, per Chris's own
// tracking note), these have real, already-approved content:
//  - F-03/F-04 SMS: workflow-coherence-audit.md "Ready-to-paste copy" section.
//  - F-07 SMS: same section (Funding Locked).
//  - AX-07 SMS: same section (Funding Paused / Blocker).
//  - Round Started SMS: Workflow-SMS-Fixes-Ready-to-Paste.md.
//  - F-03/F-04 email + F-07 email (FR22 "Total Funding Locked"): EMAIL-TEMPLATES-
//    SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md (grepped for these specific keys only, per instructions —
//    this file was never read wholesale).
// Copy here is audit-scrubbed (opt-out present, no restricted wording), but
// compliance_passed is seeded false: owner decision 2026-08-04 — human approval
// in the template editor (migration 116) turns send on.
