// THE COUNTER IS DERIVED FROM THE LOG, NOT INCREMENTED ALONGSIDE IT.
// `inquiry_log.call_attempts` and `inquiry_attempts` would drift the first time
// a request was retried — the classic double-count, and here it lands on a
// consumer's dispute record. So the counter is recomputed from the attempt rows
// inside the same transaction that inserts one. Two sources, one write, no
// possible disagreement.
//
// A 'note' IS NOT AN ATTEMPT. Working notes are logged in the same table, for a
// single readable timeline, but do not count toward call_attempts: a desk that
// inflates its attempt count is lying to a bureau, slowly.
