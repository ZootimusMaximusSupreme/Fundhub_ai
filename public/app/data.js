/* Fundhub app data layer — the one place a screen asks for real records.
 *
 * Every call resolves; none reject. A screen that asks for data it cannot get
 * keeps whatever it already rendered, so a backend outage degrades to the
 * built-in sample markup rather than to a blank page.
 *
 * ONE NAMED EXCEPTION: read()'s `params` argument. That is not a runtime
 * condition — a backend being down, a record not existing — it is the
 * calling screen's own code being wrong, and this file's history says a
 * silent one is worse than a crash. finance-os.html once passed a pre-built
 * query STRING where read() wanted a params OBJECT; `for (var k in params)`
 * iterated the string's characters instead of throwing, and the result was a
 * malformed request that still came back looking like an answer — 400 on an
 * endpoint that validates its parameters, and a silently wrong org-wide
 * roll-up on one that does not. See read() below: a non-object, non-undefined
 * `params` throws synchronously, on purpose, rather than being handed to the
 * loop that produced that bug.
 *

 * The return shape is always { ok, source, data, error }:
 *   ok:false source:"unauthorized" — signed out, or the session is stale
 *   ok:false source:"nodb"         — the DATABASE said it was down (503, or
 *                                    db:"down" in the body). Nothing else.
 *   ok:false source:"server"       — the API answered, and the answer was an
 *                                    error our own code produced. See below.
 *   ok:false source:"offline"      — /api/* is not deployed or unreachable
 *   ok:false source:"notfound"     — backend is fine; that record does not exist
 *   ok:false source:"badrequest"   — backend is fine; the parameter was bad
 *   ok:false source:"nodata"       — the screen had nothing to ask about
 *   ok:false source:"demo"         — demo session, no read attempted
 *   ok:true  source:"api"          — real rows
 *
 * "notfound"/"badrequest" are NOT outages. A screen must report them as a read
 * that did not come back, with a reason, never as "backend unavailable" — see
 * the reference wiring in client-control-panel.html. No failure message calls
 * what is left on screen "sample": this layer does not know what the screen is
 * still showing, and UI-STANDARDS §6 forbids sample data dressed as real.
 *
 * "nodb" vs "server" is the same class of distinction and it was got wrong for
 * the same reason (audit m17). Every non-ok body used to be classified "nodb",
 * so a handler that threw — netlify/functions/api.mjs:334 answers 500
 * { ok:false, error:"internal_error" }, and :327 answers 500
 * { ok:false, error:"handler_no_response" } — reached the user as a database
 * outage. Whoever got paged spent it checking Postgres while the fault sat in
 * the function logs. "nodb" is now reserved for the database saying so itself.
 *
 * Screens must branch on `ok` and never assume `data` is populated. See
 * client-control-panel.html for the reference wiring.

       write — the POST half. Same contract as get(): it ALWAYS resolves, never
       rejects, and returns the same { ok, source, data, error } shape, so a
       screen branches on `ok` exactly once whether it is reading or writing.

       WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN EACH SCREEN. Until the Finance OS screens
       landed, every wired screen was read-only and this file had no writer, so
       the first screen that needed to POST would have hand-rolled the token
       header, the JSON encoding and the status classification — and the next
       five would have hand-rolled them again, slightly differently. Six copies
       of "how do we tell a 403 from an outage" is six chances to tell a user
       the database is down when their session simply expired. One copy, here.

       IT REUSES get()'s CLASSIFICATION DELIBERATELY, including the distinction
       audit m17 was about: a crashed handler is source:"server", and only the
       database saying so itself is source:"nodb".

       A 501 IS NOT AN OUTAGE AND MUST NOT BE REPORTED AS ONE. The eight
       /api/finance/* routes are registered before their handlers are finished
       and answer 501 not_implemented in the meantime — deliberately, so a
       feature cannot be built and left unreachable (netlify/functions/api.mjs).
       That is "built, not finished", which is a true and useful thing to put in
       front of somebody; "we could not reach the server" is not. It gets its own
       source so a screen can say so.

       DEMO SESSIONS DO NOT WRITE. A demo session holds a sentinel token, not a
       credential. A read under one falls back to sample markup harmlessly; a
       WRITE under one would either be rejected or, worse, accepted — so it is
       refused here rather than attempted. */
