/* FundHub client portal — service worker.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING IN THIS FILE.
 *
 * A service worker is code the browser keeps and runs even when the site is
 * closed. That is what makes push notifications possible, and it is also the
 * single most dangerous thing on this site, because a bad one CANNOT BE FIXED
 * BY DEPLOYING A FIX — the stale worker is what serves the page that would have
 * loaded the fix. Get this wrong and every client who ever opened the portal is
 * stuck on a broken version of it, permanently, on their own device.
 *
 * So this file follows four rules and none of them are negotiable.
 *
 * 1. NETWORK FIRST, ALWAYS. The cache is a fallback for a failed request and
 *    never a preference. A cache-first worker is how a site freezes.
 *
 * 2. NOTHING UNDER /api/ OR /.netlify/ IS EVER CACHED. Not once, not briefly.
 *    Those responses carry a client's financial file and travel with their
 *    login token. A cached copy is a copy sitting on the device after they sign
 *    out. This is enforced twice below — once by refusing to cache the path,
 *    and once by the SCOPE: this worker is registered for the single URL
 *    /app/client-portal.html, so a request to /api/ never reaches it at all.
 *
 * 3. THERE IS A KILL SWITCH. Flip KILL_SWITCH to true, deploy once, and every
 *    installed copy of this worker deletes its caches and unregisters itself the
 *    next time the browser checks. The page also honours ?push=off. One deploy
 *    undoes the whole feature.
 *
 * 4. THE CACHE IS VERSIONED AND OLD VERSIONS ARE DELETED ON ACTIVATE. Bump
 *    CACHE_VERSION with any change to what is cached.
 *
 * WHAT IS CACHED: one thing. The portal page itself, so that opening the app
 * with no signal shows the last page instead of the browser's dinosaur. Nothing
 * else — no scripts, no styles, no data. Those are outside this worker's scope
 * and are fetched by the browser normally.
